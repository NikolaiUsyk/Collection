### Sonnet for Amanda

The atoms here are so predictable,
They're chosen for their bland nobility.
Our concrete walls are non-combustible,
They're safe they lack all volatility

But everything there is to know of Earth
Has not been dreamt of by philosophy.
The nature of all things born of turf
Has been to act quite unpredictably.

We're not immune to matter's mystery,
These atoms hold much more than we can know.
Our hearts, suffuse with furtive chemistry
Know not which counterparts will make them glow.

When I'm with you we're brighter than the sun.
Together 'til the sands of life o'er run.
