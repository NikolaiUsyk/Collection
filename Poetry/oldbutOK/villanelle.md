### Snow Day

That austere landscape indifferent and white,
Each form, alone, from all others bereft,
Passing through time, the never ending flight.

Each animal, each tree, each man, each fight
For life on the island where we are left,
An austere landscape indifferent and white.

The world a blank slate, reflects the sun bright,
Dappled colored forms, from all else are cleft,
Passing through time, our never ending flight.

A glowing world dominates at sun's height,
Unraveling each form, stripping its weft,
That austere landscape indifferent and white.

The empty surface, a mass all alight,
Obscures all, engulfs all with hand so deft,
Passing through time, the never ending flight.

Objects reappear, the sun falls to night,
And I, all alone, from all else bereft,
An austere landscape indifferent and white,
Passing through time, the never ending flight.
