### Tidal Wave

The sapphire sea suddenly bulges;
an indescribable ejaculation of
erstwhile serenity
Leaps on thehorizon.

People flee their stations
the approaching aquatic juggernaut
crushes itself
against the like sky.

Panicked, they trample
anticipating annihilation
overwhelming
until

a gentle, blameless breaker licks
the coast with a languid
whisper.

Emotion Deceives.
