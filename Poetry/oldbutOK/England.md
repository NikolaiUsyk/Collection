### England

Landmarks

That mark the moments we've made
Bear down on me like cracked columns of old monuments
Or rusty blades on bayonets.
The war's long over and the massacred
are forgotten, drowning under dandelions

And we are similar, old warriors
Succumb to the fight
Given up, drawn our last pining sigh
Years later, each other etched out of daily memory
We'll flash into each others' mind
Like the equestrian statue in the corner of our vision

And notice the crack that we hadn't noticed before
Where the light rain split the heavy clay
The point that marked the beginning of the end.
