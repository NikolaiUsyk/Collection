### Pubic hair poem

The hairs are curled like hooks, they catch
and they cloy one another 
Locking locked bodies.
Thickwith juices and sweat.
They serve no function, harbingers of puberty
blind thickets, misplaced manes of genitalia.
They are shaved and waxed.
Unsightly curved follicles begone.
You repulse me!

Until that moment when we disconnect
And as I roll over, off of your body,
I feel our hairs, wet, curled and soft
intertwined and pulling apart like
little fingers on little hands desperately
grasping for each other.
