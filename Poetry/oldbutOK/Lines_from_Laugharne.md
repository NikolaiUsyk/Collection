### Lines from Laugharne

The castle in moonlight looks black and white
Like Humphrey Bogart in ‘Casablanca.’
It’s chiseled chin of brick, Earth, and mortar
Juts out from a plain over an estuary.
And from the empty promontory above
One can see the hills of the coast
Rolling down to the mouth of a stream at the sea.

And when I look at this Breton castle
On a distant rocky coast, I cannot help but
Be reminded of dusk encroaching upon
The lived-time midsummer evenings when I was an immortal
On a bike, when the moon crept up my sky
And turned my world two-tone, far away
From any moonlit Welsh shore.

I would pedal furiously, wearing out
An orbit around an empty center with no
Intimation of any world outside of my narrow strip
Of asphalt and concrete and two wheels turning turning
And the rock that I didn’t see that threw me --
Tumbling to Earth, scraping my soft hands open to
Reveal the ichor within.
Smooth. Sticky.

It smelled sweet and sugary and
I looked at in in amazement, wondering
What it was that coursed through me in
The dimming days that should have lasted forever.

I neutralized the leakage in my hands
With leakage from my eyes.

Now I know that my ichor was blood and
That my mortal coil will wither, and so
My memory is estranged from me, as if
It had happened to anyone else who still
Holds the ichor and forgets their mortality
So that this verse, not in verse, does nothing, nothing
To bring me back or convey the feeling of
What I once knew. And so it lives, not in me,
But like a droplet encrusted in ice 
Floating down a river, the Taf, Schulykill, Willamette or Lethe
Toward the castle by the estuary that leaks
All the water in the world out into an ocean
Where every milliliter is a moment in a lifetime.
