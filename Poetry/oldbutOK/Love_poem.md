"Love poem"

If ere a woman were beauty darling
darling, surely thee.
If ere a woman were loved by man then
darling, surely thee.
And when the sun glanc'd off thine eyes,
Thou shouldst take it as no surprise
To find me looking from 'neath my guise
Enamored in thine beauty; laid bare.
But how should I look! Oh how could I stare!

Oh how could I forget you darling
darling, nev'r me.
Oh daily I meet you rising darling
rising, o'er the sea.
Burgeoning like Phoebus o'er the land
Spreading light with thy gentle hand,
And in our bed, never to demand.
But you left me lone in that bed,
Now, a dark place to lay my head.

You were like the sun my darling,
darling, only thee.
Oh you left me in the darkness darling
darling, only thee.
And I recall thy heavenly caress
The one before you begin to undress
And now I find myself in my own mess.
So now, because I will never outlive this love,
I must resign myself to what I find above.oveabove.
