### Sonnet 1, On meeting Maria

Your impact on me came out of thin air,
Unrestrained beauty right before my eyes.
A vision of woman with dark brown hair,
Glasses like Rivers, your guise oh so wise.

I met you, oh existentialist queen,
Your lasting image has not left my mind.
Intelligence, laughter- beauty unseen.
So sublime- a beauty I knew I'd find.

That crimson red dress that covered your hips,
Me holding you there in a state of bliss,
You look up at me, a smile on your lips,
That vision of you I wish I could kiss.

Your image is all I have until when,
I see you, call you, talk to you, again.
