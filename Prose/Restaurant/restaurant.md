## Scenes from an Italian Restaurant

### 1

It rests off the side of one of those great arteries of the interstate highway system.
The exit ramp leads onto a road that will take one into a small cozy town outside a great metropolis of the Eastern United States.
Right off of the road, just off of the interstate lies the restaurant.
It's parking lot is like a capillary where the blood from the artery slides into a smaller vessel and finally into the small area near the outside of the dermis, resting for a short time and making the cheeks blush.
The cheeks aren't blushing right now though, it's the middle of the day, granted, but the cheeks haven't really glowed like they used to in awhile.
The business is waning and everyone knows it.
You could tell just by looking at the outside.
The once brilliant reds now blend right into the weathered brick of the building, and the greens have lost their luster completely.
Even the neon sign is deteriorating, it's letters g, t, and i have gone out labeling the building as nonsense.

Kurt parks he beat up old car in one of the spaces furthest from the front door, which are reserved for the employees.
He walks toward the looming restaurant, it really isn't any wonder it has fallen into a state of quasi-disrepair, when anyone has to look over that much square footage, it will inevitably decay unless there are unlimited funds at one's dispense.
It has the vaulted ceiling of a grand old church, with support beams crisscrossing each other stories over the customers heads.
It definitely wasn't a church, or maybe it is.
An altar to the post-industrial era maybe.
It was probably once a farmers market before the area became suburbanized, and the small town lost what its originality and became another bourgeois suburb for people with means who needed to get out of the deteriorating urban center.
Its original purpose was more natural than its adopted one.

It had been there since Kurt was a kid growing up in the area.
He remembered wondering why they needed so much space to cook food, and why there were all kinds of crazy articles of Americana on the walls.
He vaguely remembered the antiquarian advertisements that lined the walls when he went there as a kid, but when he started working there they etched themselves into his brain.
He remembered each one, from the stained glass Popeye comic strip, to the advertisements hawking 25 cent packs of cigarettes of a brand that has been defunct since the sixties.
They were now unforgettable, he knew where each one would be when he opened the door.

He expected her to be there too, right where she was leaning against the podium with her arms crossed underneath her subtle breasts, and her blonde hair stretching to just below her neck marking the contrast between her hair and her black sweater.
She picks her head up.
Her eyes are brown.

"Hey, how's it goin?"
He asks.

"Chillin, it's not busy or nothin here."

"Ah, it might get busy in a bit.
Where am I tonight?"
He leans over and looks at the floor plan over her shoulder.
"Damn it, I'm like last cut.
The one goddamned night I want to go home and I'll be stuck here all night."

"Hey, I got here first and I'm going to be here last.
I don't understand it."

"Well I guess we can stay later together then."

She gives a harrumph and a smirk to that and leans back over the podium.

He turns to leave and remarks, "Either way, you better not seat the hell outta me tonight.
I'm not in the mood."

She turns and yells after him, "Don't worry, I'll give you all you can handle"

He smiles and imagines that she was talking about something else.

The lights are dimmed in the dining hall, and the colors in the stained and detailed carpet are mixed together to form a dull shade of grey.
The kitchen is bathed in hollow yellow light and the drink room is glowing a pale pink from the fluorescent light above the cups.
It's all eerie, and Kurt wants to go the hell home.
It's a long time to be somewhere from 4 to 1, especially at night.
The night holds such possibility under its black cape, like a bag with an infinite interior.
This is a humid summer night too; the kind where the temperature is 75 but the sweat comes pouring from your pores.
Where the air hangs heavy, expectant.
There is no expectation working on a night like this, just a little bit of money to keep one's head above water and lungs full of air for a few days until it runs out and the cycle starts all over again.
The night is lost.
Its potential energy has become kinetic and dissipated into the atmosphere.

Kurt goes out to the office looking for a manager so that he can give the money he owes, keep the rest, and get home.
The manager isn't there though, and neither is the security guard.
He thinks of how odd it is, the manager is always the last one here.
The manager has to stay, count the money, and fill out bureaucratic bullshit about sales, demographics, and hourly wages.
There's no way he could be gone by now, he must be in another section, possibly in the freezer counting the steaks.
And the security guard must be with him or outside smoking a cigarette.
He walks back into the kitchen in its eerie phosphorescence and goes down the almost pitch black hall toward the walk-in refrigerators and freezers.

"Jim.
Hey Jim!"
He yells in the hallway.
"Are you there?
Turn on the goddamned light would ya."
There's no answer.
He walks down the hallway and finds the refrigerators deserted and the freezer padlocked.
"What the fuck?"
He exclaims to himself.
"I really wanna get the hell out of here."
He continues ahead to go out to the lobby through the dish-room via the dining hall.
Maybe he'll be able to find the guard to let him out and leave his money near the office for the manager to find.
Whenever he comes back from whatever he's doing because, it's just too late to be going through this bullshit.

He stops immediately when he turns the corner into the dish-room.
It is awash in a blue glaze of light, which seems almost tactile.
He's afraid that he'll slip if he does not tread carefully along the floor.
The sheen metal of the dishwasher and the racks are glowing in this light.
He walks around the equipment to where the strange light is emanating from.
There is an odd halogen bulb with a dark blue covering on it hanging in the corner of the room across from the dishwasher.
Across from this is a set of steps that has never been there before.
Normally racks for glasses are put there at the end of the night but this time they are not there, they have disappeared and there is only this narrow linear staircase.
Kurt walks over to it and down the staircase.
It ends in pitch black about ten steps down.
There is a door there.
He takes the knob.
It acquiesces to his wrist.

Behind the door there is a room with a single light bulb on the ceiling in the center.
It has a chain pull hanging from it and swaying inexplicably.
It is on, and the pale yellow light illuminates a small cot on the far wall.
The room is no more than 18' by 18', its walls are musty stone, the air is heavy with moisture.
Kurt closes the door behind him and lies down on the cot.

"I don't have the goddamned ticket!"
He shouted from behind the line.

"Just make the damn food.
I need five lasagnas right *now*."
A larger man shouted from the other side of the metal frame where the food was delivered to the people who take it to the customers (or guests, as modern marketing would demand they be called.)

"Jim, I didn't have the goddamned ticket, the people must have changed their minds, or the waiter didn't ring it up right.
I don't fuckin know.
But I don't have anymore lasagna it's going to be another five to ten minutes, I can't speed it up."

"Why the hell weren't you prepared?"

"Because I had enough, I knew how much I needed and I had enough, now all of a goddamned sudden I need more.
People must be taking two or three of these."

"Jesus, they're gonna be bitching at me because you didn't do your job right."

"No, I did my job right.
This isn't a problem of me, it's a problem of you and *your* goddamned wait staff not being organized."

"My wait staff?!?
I run the *whole* restaurant here; *you*'re part of *my* staff too.
I just don't know for how long."

"Oh great, oh great.
Threaten me, what great motivation techniques."

"You should always have more than enough supplies; you know that you've been doing this too goddamned long not to know that.
I need five lasagnas, as soon as possible.
I'm gonna go check on the party."
He leaves the kitchen with heavy long strides.

Meanwhile outside:

Kurt is holding two lasagnas in a room with five long tables against a wall and one very long table perpendicular to them.
All the seats are full; there are about eighty people in the room.
He goes up to one of the long tables and yells above the din, "Meat lasagna!
Who had the meat lasagna?"
There is no response, so he yells louder.
"Meat lasagna!"
A boy looks up almost annoyed and stretches his hands out.
Kurt gives him the plate and to a girl who looks at him shyly and half puts up her hand he gives the other plate.

He walks to the next table and does the same thing until an older woman comes up to him and says, "Excuse me, excuse me, sir!"

He turns around as children stretch up their hands for the food in front of him; he looks annoyed but answers politely, "Yes."

"Sir, we have been waiting for our food for quite some time now, *and* we'd like refills on drinks."
She looks at him accusingly he's incredulous.

"Ma'am, please, the cooks can only make the food so fast, and I can only get it out so fast, I will be with you as soon as I can."
He's using all the restraint he can muster.

"I'd like to speak to your manager."
She looks really annoyed now.

"Ma'am, he's busy right now preparing your food personally.
I will let him know that you want to speak to him."
He's incredulous, but masks it well.

It's amazing that people can see how busy you are and still not care.
They want their service now and screw anyone else even though they're all with the same group.
He hands two plates of the lasagna off.
A kid says thank you, he smiles.

Vectors are truly amazing things.
The interplay between forces that construct the movements and actions in our world never cease to astound me.
The force of gravity working its way in harmony with the force of electromagnetism that constructs the world, provides razor thin boundaries between different forms of matter, and causes objects to have definite forms all affect each and every action you perform.
I walk around the restaurant and my feet are buoyed up by the force of electromagnetism in the carpet and my shoes.
The atoms resist each other and make sure that because I stepped on the carpet, our atoms don't combine and I do not become a sort of carpet human hybrid.

The vectors make all this possible, and the organized state of matter lets me manipulate things with my own forces.
The bartender pours me a pint and I pick it up and put it on my tray with two cokes and an iced tea.
I walk up the step away from the bar as Kevin comes barreling down because he's in a rush and has about five tables right now.
The vectors applied on him by his customers and the restaurant fuel his rush.
I quickly avoid him turning my tray twenty degrees from perpendicular while I dodge, but the drinks do not fall even on this slanted surface.
They remain intact because the force of gravity did not overcome the frictional force on the sandpaper bed of my tray.
When I snap my wrist and bring the tray back to perpendicular, while the liquid in the drinks was about to spill it was caught by the cups as they move, returning to their former position.
Everything remains intact.

I go to the table and set the drinks down in front of the people who ordered them.
My force is holding the glass aloft and deftly resisting gravity setting the glass down lightly in front of each person, before I apply a vector of my own to the situation.

"Would you like to start off with an appetizer for the table?
Perhaps, the Mozzarella Sticks or the Grand Sampler."
I say with suggestiveness and subtlety.

"Hmm, maybe."
The man whom I served the beer to begins.
"What do you think, Molly?"

"I suppose we could take one of those Grand Samplers."
She says quietly while looking at the menu.

"Yeah," he says, "yeah, let's have a Grand Sampler."

"All right, I'll go put that order in and it'll be up in a few minutes."
I pause slightly, "I'll be right back to take your order."

They yielded to the force.
Archenemies once said that if you showed him the place he could move the world with a lever.
This isn't exactly the world, but you need to know the place to place the lever.

Back in the kitchen people are moving in all directions at once.
Scurrying this way and that they are all using their individual vectors to push this restaurant along at its essence.
John Nash would have had a hell of a time looking at a place like this; it's enough to give a chaos theorist a hard on.
Where are they all going, where can I find the pattern, what equation unlocks this mystery of life?
It would have been more informative than looking at pigeons or newspaper clippings all day long, that's for sure.
All these people, all involved in pushing, shoving, levering the restaurant with their forces, their personal vectors.
Now if only any one of them knew where they were pushing it to.

Awww, Kurt man you shoulda seen this place in its heyday, back about three years ago.
Yeah, you came in as a kid an ate here, I heard ya, but I was workin ere right runnin these tables like it was an O-lympic relay race.
Yeah now you make maybe seventy bucks on a good night where you got a good section, three four tops at least and maybe a big rounder to shove a good party or two in and collect the fat grat there, but I tell you what if you had that section two years ago, guaranteed you had three parties and you'd run those three four tops round four times at least.
You know that's money, that's when there's money in a restaurant.
I tell you I never walked out of here on a weekend night with less than one fifty, never any less.
You just do the math is all.
You take three four tops there run em four times maybe one five and you got thirteen fourteen tables ere.
Two tops four tops the whole gamut.
At least averaging eight per table, this is when the clientele was classier too.
Take a nice three top back in the day and the bill was fifty every fuckin time, I'm tellin ya a fifty dollar bill back in the day use ta mean a ten dollar no brainer tip.
Now with these trashy folks comin in here all the time for the "affordable dining and kid friendly atmosphere" you're lucky to get seven offa fifty.
We never use ta get kids in here, fuck the kids man, that ain't no money.
Add four dollars to the goddamned check with dessert and a soda, fuck that's just charity work.
Now they come in in swarms, six tops of all kids anymore like they're handin drivers licenses out at toys are us and the kids flock here by themselves.
Goo goo gaga all over the steering wheel am I right Kurt, heh heh heh.
But no if you take that eight dollars each on maybe thirteen tables you come up with 104 bucks, more money than you'll ever see here anymore and that's without adding in the nice six top if you got it.
Take the gratuity on that and get overtipped a bit if you're good.
That's an easy fifteen off each time its sat.
It'd get sat three times no problem, on a weekend night that's forty five big ones off of that table and there you go 149 dollars, before tip out of course, but this is a conservative estimate of how it used to be.
You got here too late, bucko.
This place is dyin, the people are changin ever time you turn around they got new hires an half of em leave within two weeks cause they see they ain't gonna be able to make rent on this shit.
Hell I'm aimin at the manager position, and I think I'm gonna get it soon too.
Soon as they send one of the masturbators they got here off to some store in Alabama or Kalamazoo, I'll be in.
Then I'll be able to make a livin.

The crossbeams of the cathedral-like ceiling were a mess.
Half of them had fallen and the arching wooden ceiling itself was starting to creak.
It was all on fire.
Kurt rushed back into the building as if it was his house that was burning and he could hear the whimper of his trusty black lab from inside.
He was standing outside with the rest of the staff and customers who quickly and safely evacuated the building.
He stood there looking around, but could not find her.
Her brown eyes were like beacons to him at work.
He could sense them.
He saw her from behind him; he knew where she was whenever she was near, even if she was just out of sight.
She was not outside; he could tell and he had a bad feeling about everything.
The fire department had been called but they were still two or three minutes away by his estimation.
The flames began to ripple through the roof of the building.
He saw one emerge, then another, and then another on the far side of the building.
It was only a matter of time before the structure would crumble to the ground in a heap of burning rubble and brown eyes.

He saw the dining room was a maze of fallen and crackling beams that were previously four stories in the air.
As he walked in another one came crashing down in the middle of the room engulfed in flame.
The carpet wasn't on fire everywhere, there were damp parts of it and parts that the fire was not prepared to inhabit.
Possibly because the patterns were too ugly.
He walked into the room jumping over a fallen, flaming beam and catching a glimpse of her lying motionless on a patch of unscathed carpet.
He hurdled a few more beams and came to her lying, unconscious on the carpet, soot in her face, breathing softly.
She had her arm above her head lying on her side.
She landed like that when she fainted about five minutes ago.
The fire must have started from an electrical fault in the cavernous arch of the building's roof.
The wiring was never maintained too well, it's practically impossible for anyone to get up there in the first place.
There may have been a spark and then a small blue flame on the wood.
The draft from the old worn roof may have spurred on the infant flame until it grew and started eating away at the beam toward the back of the restaurant.
No one would have noticed this going on so far above their heads until the crackling became evident.
It would have started as a background noise and grown like the buzz of a cicada to inhabit the room, until people would start wondering, where's that crackling coming from.
Just as she was leading back a family of five to a booth in the back of the room they would look up and scream.
Just as they screamed it would have fallen right behind her and in front of the lagging family.
The kids scream, the parents grab them and run.
She probably turned around and, faced with a burning ceiling beam fainted.

Her shirt was pulled tight around her breasts and revealed a sliver of skin at her hips betraying their curves.
Kurt was dumbfounded, he tried to wake her up by shaking her and pulling her off the ground.
But she only flailed limply at his hands.
He looked around at the smoke filled room, knowing that in a few minutes if she didn't get air she would die.
He was starting to feel woozy himself and knew that he couldn't carry her outside dodging these fallen beams and patches of flame.
He made a decision and breathed in under his shirt where he believed there maybe be fresh air for some reason.
He held the breath and knelt down over her prostrate body opening her mouth and closing her nasal passage.
He breathed into her mouth, and she coughed.
Her eyes opened slowly and when they did it seemed as though light pierced them from behind.
They lit up his face like a searchlight, and he was caught like a deer.
She tried to stand up but couldn't; her face was full of fear.
Kurt knelt down over her when she fell and, as if compelled by a force greater than the fire itself, kissed her full on the mouth.
Her mouth rose to meet his and her full lips returned his force.
The fire blazed it blazed it blazed.

The restaurant began to float.
It floated up above the clouds, and looked down on it's parking lot with contempt.
The customers and workers who were still there all walked out of the restaurant and fell to their deaths.
It's a good thing only the people that Kurt didn't like were working that day.

They taught him in the five day training session for the job (whenever it only takes five days to learn a job you know a monkey could do it) to recognize and cut off guests who are clearly intoxicated.
This of course seemed like superfluous instruction for a family restaurant with a modest drink menu, but in the mad modern world one must be prepared for anything.

Kurt knew that the man would want to drive home, as ridiculous and suicidal the notion was.
There were two women with him, one was probably his wife the other was probably his daughter.
They looked frightened while he hooted and hollered drunkenly, disrupting the entire restaurant.
Families looked over disapprovingly and annoyed at such an intrusion to their meal.
The two women were humiliated.
Kurt walked over to the table to see if there was anything else they needed and to ask him to please keep it down.

"Hey man, how'sa bout anuther bourbon here.
Johnny Walker on the rocks, you know what to do.
Heh, heh, heh.
Hey you guys want anythin else."
He turned to his family who looked sheepishly, apologetically at Kurt and shook their heads.

He knew what he had to do, he could not give this man any more to drink.
It'd be illegal, irresponsible, and jeopardizing.
He said after a short pause, "I'm sorry sir, I don't think you should have any more alcohol."

The women's faces thanked him, but his face went very swiftly from laughter to seriousness, "What?
Well you right bout one thing youngun: you don't think.
Now I want you to get me more bourbon and I want you to get it for me *now*.
You're the server; I'm the customer; what I say goes.
Got it."

Kurt could see his glazed over eyes dance; it was like watching fire behind translucent glass.
He wasn't exactly sure what to do; he'd never had an argument with a customer.
They said he'd be fired if he did, but they also said that he'd be fired if he served this guy.
He'd never had anyone just pick a fight with him this blatantly.
Maybe getting fired wouldn't be so bad either.
Giving this guy more drinks would probably be bad though, for everyone.
Kurt looked over his shoulder and realized that his words were louder than he thought.
The entire restaurant was watching him pause, including the other servers and one of the managers.
They were all rooted to the spot.

"Sir, be reasonable-" Kurt began.

"I *am* being reashonable," He was slurring his words as he increased his volume.
"I want anuther fuckin bourbon, jeesh, waiters anymore 're so goddamned uppity about a man who likes him some bourbon."

Kurt couldn't deal with this kind of confrontation so he abruptly turned around and walked away not knowing what to do.
He was stopped by the manager who saw it happen.
"Jesus, Kurt, what's going on over there?"

"That guy is flat drunk, he's not in condition to walk let alone drive.
The girls are scared shitless and he wants *liquor.*"

"Christ, I'll go over and talk to him."
The manager left to go over to the table.

Kurt walked to the door of the kitchen and looked out into the dining room where the manager was talking to him.
He started yelling at the manager saying that he was going to have him fired.
The manager told him to get out of the restaurant or else the police would be called.
He got up and grabbed his wife, yanking her out of the booth by her arm.
He yelled at his daughter and she got up reluctantly; he stormed out without paying and they followed him.
It was a scene; the whole restaurant was watching awkwardly.

The manager came back and called the police notifying them that there was a drunk driver leaving the restaurant.
He was eventually picked up and jailed for the night.
The restaurant sent the bill to jail.
They made him pay it.
The next day Kurt came in the manager gave him five bucks.
Kurt asked what it was for.
The manager told him that the guy left a tip.
He must have felt bad when he sobered up.

It was six o'clock on a Thursday night when Kurt picked up the phone, "Hello, thank you for calling.
My name is Kurt.
How may I help you?"

"Yes, is Jim the general manager there?
This is Brian Creeley from the corporate office in White Plains, Michigan.
It's very important that I speak with him immediately."\ Kurt froze for a second and then said, "Yes, of course, um, I'll go get him right away."

He pressed hold, put the receiver back and went looking for the manager.
He found him and told him that someone was calling from the big corporate office.
The manager let out a heavy sigh and picked up the phone slowly.
Kurt walked away back toward the host stand where she was standing.
She looked at him intently and her mouth was drawn back in a seductive smile.
He blushed slightly and avoided her gaze, but she kept looking.
So he looked back and gave what he intended to be a cocky, cool smile out the side of his mouth.
Her expression didn't change, but after he passed he gave himself a bop on the head and imagined that his smile was less cool and more like a nervous tick.
So he walked into the dining room and attended to the only table that he had a charge over in the large but barren restaurant.

He walked back to the dish room with arms full of their salad plates.
He set them down and walked back to the soda room where ten or twelve servers were gathered simply standing around.
He walked into a rather animated conversation about the state of their jobs.
One of the women yelled, "I don't make no money anymore.
How'm I gonna support myself.
This is bullshit, I'm gonna get cut in another ten minutes and rent is due tomorra.
I can't do it here anymore.
I remember when we all used to make well over a hundred a night all the time, but that ain't here no more.
I needed a hundred tonight and I got twenty.
Twenty goddamned dollars, there ain't no tables, we all need new jobs, this ain't getting it done."

She finished her tirade and another server argued, "You know it's always like this in the summer Cynthia.
It's always been like this.
This doesn't mean that the restaurant is going downhill.
There's feast and there's famine and right now is the famine.
It happens like this every year.
No use complaining about it."
He finished and then looked behind him, "Hey, the salad's out now."
He looked at Kurt, "That's your sidework, go get some more salad out of the walk-in."

"Fine, I'll get some salad."
Kurt answered, "God knows why I do this job for peanuts, and I still do all the bitchwork at the same time."
He grumbled and walked down the hallway to the walk-in refrigerator.

He walked into the walk-in and as the big door shut behind him he saw her bending over looking for something.
He froze, then he thought for a second, smiled and said, "Having trouble finding something?"

She turned around with a start.
She looked surprised but then her face softened and she looked at him with marked interest.
"Yes, I'm looking for the tomatoes.
You walk back into the soda room where everyone's standing around doing nothing and then all of a sudden that jerk who thinks he the king of the restaurant just because he's supervising tells you to go get something that you don't even know where to find.
It's stupid."
She said this all in one breath almost.

"Whoa, slow down there."
Kurt turned and pulled the tomatoes off the shelf next to him, "I know you don't have to come back here much, but they're right here."
He held out the tomatoes.
She walked up to him quickly and took them.

"Thanks, Kurt."
She turned to go past him, but he stuck his hand out and blocked her feeling the smoothness of her stomach with his hand through her sweater.

"You know," Kurt began with a big smile, "I don't think you've found *everything* that you're looking for."

When he stopped her, her hair had fallen down over her face.
Now she looked up at him intently through her hair with a smirk on her face.
"So, what exactly do you think I was looking for back here so far away from the host stand, Kurt?"
She straightened up while she said this.

Kurt looked right at her and put his face close to hers, "I'm not sure, but maybe I can find it for you."
He said in his best low voice.

\

Meanwhile Jim was on the phone with the corporate representative.

"That's right, Jim, you are ordered to shut down all operations within the next two hours.
Close up shop, your store is closed."

"So, so what.
What're you saying, everyone is fired, just like that.
Just like *that*.
All these people are out of a job, what're they going to do.
You didn't leave any goddamned notice.
Why, why didn't you tell us."
Jim was becoming animated.

"Because if I had then the place would have gone amok, everyone would have stolen items, and no one would have done their jobs.
We're shutting you down to cut costs because you don't make enough profit.
We need to make money, we're not doing so well.
You're simply a casualty."

"Oh, Jesus Christ, you fire all these people at once without the blink of an eye, blame it on the system.
We're just casualties, yeah, well some of us are going to end up being casualties.
Jesus this just isn't right."

"Well it may not be, but it's what's happening.
And you better not tell anyone before you're ready to close the doors for good, because your next job will probably ride on this going smoothly.
Got it."

"Yeah Yeah, I got it."

"If you do this right, we'll set you up with another job.
The restaurant's failure wasn't your fault, it's circumstantial.
The demographics in the community turned unfavorably.
You'll be fine, just make a smooth exit."

"Alright, I'll keep it together."

Just as he said that, Jared, one of the servers slowly walked away.
He had come to ask Jim to void off an item on his table's check, but when he heard Jim's outburst he stopped and listened.
He heard everything; he immediately went back to the soda room where everyone was standing.
He threw his arms in the air and declared, "Well that's it folks, pack your bags get out of here, fuck your sidework.
Go home, your jobs are gone, gone, GONE!"

Everyone stared at him quizzically as he started cracking up.
"Don't you get it," he reiterated, "The restaurant is closing in two hours, for good.
You, me, and all the managers and all, we're all fired.
You have no jobs!
I just overheard Jim making it very clear that corporate has just called and said we are to be shut down ASAP.
He won't tell you because he's not supposed to tell anyone.
If he closes it smoothly he'll be set up with another job at some other cheesy ass restaurant.
But I sure as hell won't.
I'm going to go steal ten steaks right now, Jerry, why don't you go flip everyone in the restaurant off.
We're done, no choice, this place is over."

Everyone stared at him incredulously as he ran down the hallway laughing manically.
He stopped and went into the walk in, looking for anything of value to stuff in his bag before he would run off.
There he saw Kurt and Suzi with their lips slammed together sticking their tongues in each other's mouths.
He fell on the floor of the refrigerator laughing like a hyena.
Kurt and Suzi turned around and looked at him, Kurt said rather coolly, "Hey Jared, man, a little privacy, eh?"

Jared just continued to laugh and finally said, "Ha, wait, wait a second.
I have something important to tell you.
He he he, You're fired!"
He went into hysterics again at this.

"What the hell are you talking about?"
Kurt asked

"Ok, ok.
Kurt, oh and Suzi, you're fired too, we're all fired, he he he.
Wait, I just overheard Jim on the phone with some corporate guy.
The restaurant is shutting down in two hours, for good.
The place is closing, but he can't tell anyone because if he shuts it down smoothly they'll set him up at another place and yada yada yada.
Whatever, it means that we're all fired anyway, so lets go steal stuff and get the fuck outta here."

"He was on the phone with a corporate guy.
I transferred the call.
Hmm, are you sure Jared?"

"I'm so sure, Kurt, that I need this job, I'm not going to make rent this month.
Right now I don't care because I know I'm done here, so now I don't care.
I'm screwed.
I'm going around doing things I'll be fired for, which I wouldn't do if I didn't know that I'd be fired either way.
So come on let's wreck the place."
Jared got up quick and ran out of the door laughing hysterically and shouting, "Barbeque at my place tonight, everyone, BARBEQUE!!"

Kurt turned back to Suzi.
She asked, "Do you think it's for real?"

"Fraid so."
He replied, "I guess we won't be seeing each other at work for awhile.
We'll have to get together outside of work, I suppose."

She grabbed him on the ass and pulled him in close, "I don't think that should be a problem.
How about my place tonight?"

"Sounds like a plan."
He said before their lips met again.

But something was bothering him as he stood there kissing her.
There was this odd buzzing, which seemed to grow louder and louder.
Until it tore at the shreds of the universe and she was gone.

Kurt sat bolt upright in bed, staring at his buzzing alarm.
It was time for work, lunch shift today.

His disappointment grew as he fumbled for his pants and walked down the hall to the bathroom.
He thought, "Well, it's bad enough they get my days for \$2.83 an hour plus tips.
Now they get my dreams for free."
