## The Lover

Sam was a boy like any other, apart from the fact that he fell in love with a look.
While other boys talked in the courtyard of their teenage conquests he was silent, for he could never make such conquests.
Women possessed his heart with a simple gaze; he could never take advantage of them or count them on an abacus as his friends could.
All in all, he didn't appear to be much different than them.
He was tall but not gaunt and fair but not pale with medium length straight brown hair crowning his head as if he were a Beatle.
By the end of their high school years his friends became suspicious of him, and some even thought that he might be a closet homosexual.
They thought that any well figured boy of seventeen who had not had adventures with the opposite sex was an oddity that couldn't be easily explained.
Sam had no defense for them, all he knew was that when he was in love he could never bear the thought of sex with his beloved.
The girls he loved became something sacred, something beyond coarse pleasure.
He thought of them as goddess like.
He made passes at and sometimes kissed girls who he was not in love with, but as soon as he would do this he would run away and sit outside with a cigarette dangling in between his middle and index finger, lamenting his infidelity and bondage to the corporal desires that he had allowed to take precedence over his spiritual love.

As Sam fell hopelessly in love with these women, sometimes the feeling was not entirely unreciprocated.
Sam had learned in his first few experiences with love that even if his feeling had begun to be returned it would not stay so for long.
It was hopeless.
Whenever he realized that he was in love it would become increasingly hard for him to talk to the object of his affection.
Soon it would get to the point where the pain of not being able to communicate his love would overcome the desire to see or look at his love until he would finally make it a point to avoid and ignore the one he loved as much as humanly possible so that even if she had fostered some attraction to him in the first place she would be so put off with his behavior by the end of the tragedy that she would have completely forgotten her initial interest.

When he was in contact with his beloved on any of those days immediately following his love\'s conception, he would immediately feel as if he were alternately irresistibly attracted and repelled by her.
He once likened it in his later years to feeling as though God himself were pulling his heart in one direction and his head in another with all the strength that the almighty can muster.
He might force himself to go talk to her, and most of the time the girls were rather receptive to his advances.
But he would grow awkward and eventually beat a hasty retreat.
He might return once or, as was usual, never again.
The girls would be left disappointed and confused by him, wondering if he was just toying with them or if he couldn't stand their personality or voice.
Often they would wonder for days on end why he was so interested and then suddenly so indifferent, until another boy came along and flattered them to no end.
Thus reviving their ego and giving them due cause to forget about Sam, who avoided them to the depths anyway.

So on he went falling in love and hiding away wondering whether he'd ever do the things that his friends did: cavorting and dating and bragging about conquests.
He approached his eighteenth birthday in the same way.
His friends were planning to throw him a party at one of their houses where the parents were away for the weekend.
They hoped that they could fix him up with a girl for the night and put to bed their fears of the friend that they had known since childhood on baseball teams and golf courses being a homosexual.
They would have admitted that they didn\'t have serious reason to suspect him because he had shown no signs of it, no high, lisping voice or any overt sexual advances toward them or any other of the boys at school.
They were, however; very concerned about his attitude toward women and the fact that they had known of no girls who he had been interested in or had sex with.
He kept all of his loves to himself in the most private manner.
They thought that all of this was very troubling and very queer.

It just so happens at this time that he had fallen in love again, to his dismay and paradoxical ecstasy, with a girl named Lois, who had been had, or so he thought, by one of the other boys in his group of friends.
His friends had an inkling of his feelings for her because they noticed that whenever her name had been brought up and discussed he would immediately leave or grow morose and somber.
Since they thought that he might fancy her, they made her first on the list of people to invite.

He had fallen in love with her rather unexpectedly, but it always happened unexpectedly.
It was a typical day, and he was sitting in the cafeteria.
She had been a classmate of his since late elementary school, and he had never really noticed her until that day, perhaps because he had been too in love with the other girls around him since she arrived in their town.
She came over to the table on a Monday where he sat with his friends as they were discussing the sporting events of the day before.
She flicked the fellow, who would begin to brag about sleeping with her as soon as she left, in the ear and whispered something to him.
She stood up laughing and all of a sudden Sam, who was sitting on the other side of the table fell in love with her in her prudish catholic school uniform covering up her buds of breasts, those delicately concave indicators of womanly potential, and her flat, athletic, field hockey player's stomach arching itself as she stood up and her dark brown hair surrounding her porcelain face making it seem all the more delicate and angelic.
It took only this moment to capture his heart and just as soon as it happened she was gone and he could not tolerate the beast who had just been his best friend giving out all the gory details of how he had molested her body that weekend.
He walked off gravely in the middle of the conversation and pried open the door that wasn't alarmed or locked to the outside world and sat there with a cigarette for the rest of the period contemplating what life was like under that frock and skirt.

Lois, for her part, had not been molested by Sam's friend.
On the contrary, she had simply allowed him to kiss her with his tongue after the dance that last Saturday after his many protestations and entreaties.
He invited her to come to the party that was to be had for Sam's birthday the next weekend with him.
She refused at first but then agreed to go, on the condition that such an appearance wasn't to be understood as a date, when he hinted to Sam\'s affection for her.
She was intrigued by the possibility of possessing the affection of the shy boy in the group of aggressive boys.
She herself was not indifferent to him at all, she was rather attracted to his retro haircut and Romanesque, angular features.
Though she didn't know what he was like at all.
She found it puzzling and intriguing that he would fancy her even though they had spoken little more than a few words in passing over the course of eight years that they had been in school together.

So the hour of the party came after Sam had endured all the graphic description of his love's manner in bed as he could possibly handle.
He had been attempting to seek out her attention in subtle ways, throwing a glance her way every now and then and trying to get his friend to bring her back to the lunch table; he refused for fear that she would embarrass him and undermine his stories.
Since the day he fell for her he had not uttered a word to her, but he had managed, he thought, to possibly communicate with her non-verbally with the few furtive glances that had been thrown back and forth between them.
He was surprised to see her at his party.
She was standing next to the keg with her friends.
He didn't know what to do at first, but then his friends threw him toward the alcohol and all he could muster was an, "Evening, ladies."
which he immediately kicked himself for and went pouring his beer into the inconspicuous Solo cup.

"Hey birthday boy.
How does the big one-eight feel.
I suppose you won't have to go around getting Robbie to buy you cigarettes anymore.
Huh?"
Her friends had left as if on cue and he was left there paralyzed holding down the tap and letting the Natty light filter heady into his cup.
He got the sense that maybe Lois already had one or two already, but her tone was unabashedly flirtatious.
He was trying desperately to think up a witty phrase to reply with.

"Oh, Robbie never bought me cigarettes.
I look older than him anyway."
He didn't stutter, half the battle right there.

"He's full of shit then I suppose.
Always bragging about this or that."

"I get that feeling too, mostly when he brags about you."
He almost winced as he said it.
Was it a faux pas?
Too early to bring up what could be an indiscretions.
He could see her walking off in anger at his jibe that he hadn't really meant.

But then she laughed.
"Ha, I can see what gets passed around at the boy's table.
I figured that's what he'd be saying.
It's all shit."

Relieved and finally letting in some air he said, "I assumed so from the first.
I couldn't imagine a girl like you ever being involved in the way he described it."

He mentally patted himself on the back for being so charming.
He even put on a sort of fake British accent for that sentence.
Then she flashed him a swift look from the corner of her eye that said, "Wanna bet."

Sam didn't know what to do.
He couldn't remember ever being looked at like that.
He felt like a bug trapped in amber.
He was surrounded by the look even after it left him and scanned the partygoers.
He didn't know what to say next, but he never had a chance to think of anything because right then four of his friends ran up and grabbed him from behind.
Evidently there was a surprise in store.

They brought him out to the living room and seated him in a chair surrounded by people.
He hadn't been at the party long and now that he had a chance to look around he was surprised at how many people had come.
He didn't even know half of them.
They must have been invited by his friends who were rather popular and knew people from all over the area.

"Alright then Sam, down it."
Sam swiftly drank the half of his beer that was left.
He felt sort of nauseous afterward, and the crowd began to sing happy birthday.
It was an uncoordinated and drunken song.
After they finished, Robbie came back brandishing a fifth of Jack Daniels.
His older brother must have graciously provided it for the party.

"Ok, Sammy boy."
Robbie was very drunk already, but the bottle hadn't been touched.
He handed him the bottle.
"Let's see you down something a bit harder now."
The crowd cheered and whistled.
Sam was apprehensive, but the entire room was cheering him on.
He knew that most people were there for the spectacle of it, but he didn't care.
The beer was already going to his head.

He took the bottle and broke the seal on the neck.
He sniffed the bottle.
It smelled like gasoline.
He closed his eyes and took a small swig.
It burned his throat and tasted horrible.
He wondered if Lois was watching.
He coughed, but the crowd cheered louder.
He felt the adrenaline and the buzz and lifted it to his lips.
He opened up his throat and let it go down.
After two swallows he felt like he was going to throw up, so he closed his throat and put it down.
He wiped the remainder off his lips and gave it back to a satisfied Robbie who proceeded to swig off of the top of the bottle.
He kept back the vomit and swayed when he stood up.
His stomach felt weak and warm.
The crowd cheered, satisfied with the entertainment.
He went to the next room and found a spot on the couch.

He stayed there for awhile on the couch.
People came up to him and patted him on the back.
They called him \"hardcore\" for the way he handled the whiskey.
He didn't really care.
Some people remembered that this was all for his birthday, wished him a happy birthday, and told him what a great party it was.
He began to think that it was a great party and in fact it was.
Some of his friends would go up and refill his cup for him.
He had drunk about five cups of beer while playing card games on the coffee table.
It was all really starting to hit him; he was aware of being rather drunk.
He knew he was losing control of his motor skills, so he decided not to go anywhere and embarrass himself by stumbling around.
Then Robbie gathered a crowd in the living room as he introduced a small bag of marijuana to the party.
The people he was playing cards with left to go smoke.
He didn't smoke; it didn't feel right to him.
He went to the bathroom instead.

He stumbled up the stairs, down the long corridor with all the bedrooms and into the bathroom.
He shut the door and positioned himself awkwardly, losing balance as he urinated.
He thought he might vomit for a second, but the nausea quickly faded and he began to think about Lois.
He hadn't seen her for two hours.
He was too indecisive to look for her.
He thought that if he went to look for her then he'd look vulnerable.
And even if he went to look for her, what would he say.
He didn't really have anything to say, she'd probably be talking with her friends, and he'd try to but into the conversation, but he wouldn't know what they were talking about, and he'd end up just leaving awkwardly and the whole thing would be spoiled because she wouldn't come looking for him after that, and he sure as hell wouldn't go back for more embarrassment.
No, he thought it'd definitely be best to play it cool, if she came to him it'd be easier anyway.
And if she doesn't come and seek him out she probably doesn't want him anyway and he wouldn't like to annoy her.
It'd be better to be a non-entity to his beloved than an annoyance.
That's what love is, thinking of the other person's well-being, he thought to himself as he struggled to maintain equilibrium.
And he was certainly thinking of her well-being by giving up and not being an annoyance.
That is of course, he thought as he flushed and zipped up his pants, unless she comes to me.

He opened the bathroom door and there she stood in the middle of the hall, facing him, illuminated only by the pale fluorescence of the bathroom light so that her shadowed hair was darker and her face was paler but flushed from drink.
Had she followed him up?
Was she waiting for him?
Could it be?
No, the surprise which registered on her face as he opened the door betrayed her; she was not waiting for him but for the bathroom.

"Oh, hey."
She sort of stammered.
He could smell the alcohol on her breath and wondered what his own breath smelled like.
He wondered what he looked like swaying in the bathroom doorway.
"I was just.
You know, I was just going.
Heh."
She pointed past him to the bathroom.
"Bathroom."
She smiled awkwardly and looked up at him standing there silent.
Her eyes were glazed over as were his, and the look that was beneath her glaze was the same as what was beneath his.
They reflected each others looks like two two-way mirrors facing each other, reflecting the same light into infinity.
It was like a tractor beam, and then, to Sam's amazement, their mouths were locked as well.

Their eyes closed.
Looks were obsolete, their mouths now conveyed meaning.
She pressed her body up to his and he wrapped his arms around her.
Their tongues passed each other.
He could feel all of her smoothness against him as he held her in his arms.
Finally it happened, finally.
He could hardly tell where he was; the world stopped existing.
All of his senses bowed out so that his sense of touch was the only one left.
He felt everything.
The world was all tactile; there was no sound or sight.
He couldn't even taste or smell; he only felt her.

As if drawn by an invisible, irresistible force they stepped slowly backwards down the empty corridor holding each other; their mouths pressed together.
It was all like a dream, he blindly searched for a doorknob in the hall and found one immediately as if through their combined will his hand was activated.
He opened the door and backed into the dark empty room.
They stumbled in and found the bed immediately.
The room was completely dark.
He could barely see her outline when he finally opened his eyes.
She instinctively pulled her tank top right off, and as he saw her doing that he pulled his up and over his head.
Then she leant over and kissed him.
He pressed himself against her, and she pulled him onto the bed over top of her.
He was at a complete loss; he was rather drunk but he didn't know exactly what he should do.
This new situation presented a whole new set of problems, was he to sleep with her.
No, damn him for even thinking that about her.
He couldn't sleep with her; he loved her.
She was beyond that, that corporeal form.
He felt something spiritual for her.
But there he was, with their genitalia lined up, on top of her, his member rigid and ready for action.
Her flesh touched his; she melted into him, and she fished around her back to undo her bra.
He should have done that earlier; he chastised himself for not thinking quickly enough.
But no, he can't possess her now, there's so much more to this.
They should wait.
Her bra came off, and he slid his hand up onto her bared breast.
He cupped it in his hand.
He had never been so stimulated.
Her hips gyrated against his and he thought that maybe he should take her now because spontaneity was the better part of love.
It's passion; it's how love makes itself known.
This would be the best time, the holiest time to consummate their spiritualities.
This spontaneous act of love, it barely needed any words; it was a cosmic understanding of two minds.
Yes, this moment was a cosmic event.
This was the perfect way; this needs to happen.
And there he lay cupping her breast, moving his hips into hers, moving his tongue around her mouth until...

The spasm in his pants took him by complete surprise.
The ejaculation seemed to embody his whole body.
He seized all over and rolled off of her to hide it.
He didn't want her to feel the spasm against her leg.
The embarrassment filled him immediately and he thought how horrible it was that he had just turned the best part, the climax, into the worst part.
The sexual desire drained from him.
He continued kissing her lying aside from her, but he was in a state of panic.
He didn't even want to kiss her, in fact, she almost repulsed him, and he didn't know why.
The world went from heaven to hell, and as her fingers scratched at his navel, he had an inkling of where she was going.
She must not have noticed, maybe she was too drunk to notice.
Her fingers began to search the region just above his pants.
They continued to kiss.
She was just about to reach her first finger into the region that he had just flooded when all of a sudden the whiskey, beer and nausea hit him like a savior tsunami.
He pulled himself away from her in one swoop and let the contents of his stomach loose on the floor.

She was shocked at first.
But she quickly changed from the role of lover to mother.
She put on her bra and top and went into the bathroom.
She emptied out a beer that was left on the ledge and filled it with water.
She gave it to Sam who shortly thereafter passed out.

Sam woke up later that night next to Lois.
It was still dark and she was asleep on the other side of the bed.
He didn't remember how he got into the bed, but he didn't really care.
He got up, and narrowly avoided putting his foot in his own puke on the side of the bed.
He picked up his shirt and put it on.
He went downstairs to find ten or so people passed out around the living room.
The clock read 5:34.
He grabbed his coat, and stepped outside.
It was crisp early March.
The light was barely showing itself on the horizon.
He sat on the porch step and lit a cigarette.
The snow was clearing, patches of brownish yellow were appearing below the dull white.
High school was over in another three months.
He was going to a university in another town after that.
He smoked on the step and thought with a kind of absolute fear in liberation about how he had no idea what to do about anything anymore.
