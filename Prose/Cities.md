## Cities

When will we realize that we're all in this together?

There is a city where everyone votes.
It has been this way for many years since universal suffrage was established for all people after their sixteenth year.
Emancipation was difficult.
The ancient inhabitants who had spawned the voters could not envision an end to the tyrants and volatile oligarchs who had cornered and cultivated power and ruled their subjects not only with an iron fist but with their personal paranoid delusions.
They proclaimed themselves gods and murdered those who remembered their birth.
They commanded from bunkers and froze their old and withered bodies in ice.
They stabbed each other in the back until the one who survived the bloodletting claimed the throne for himself.
They proved to be the culmination of all human weakness, a diseased Leviathan.

In that body politic virtues flourished.
The city grew massive as the people were fertile as the hinterland.
It was so large that some of the old inhabitants (in the time before public or motorized transportation) had misconceptions about the cities' neighborhoods that they had never seen.
One old man asserted that the people of Manayunk in the far North of the city had a system of bars suspended six feet in the air over the streets between the homes that people swung between as a mode of transportation and in consequence their arms became so strong that they could squeeze a monkey's head and make its brains squirt out of its skull a full 20 yards.
Other age wizened patriarchs told their children's children's children about the people of Cheltenham whose feet were shriveled and senseless by the time they reached adolescence because they were too poor to afford shoes on sun-scorched streets that were paved with gold.
But these were all myths, for the most part life in the city was homogenous, without one neighborhood being much better off or much different than the others even in topography.

That isn't to say that the quality of life was reasonable in proportion to the abundance that the city produced.
The rulers were so skittish that they quashed everything in the city that smacked of wealth.
The teeming harvest was thus halved, half for the ruler, who learned to eat as though he were twenty men, and half for the populous, and although there was enough for twice the population there were those who went hungry.
Until one tyrant, weak and irritable from the bloodbath that he had survived not without serious injury, condemned a man who had stolen bread for his large and hungry family.
The populace, dormant for so many years, had their strength brought out by outrage and dissolved their long-standing monocracy with one massive national outburst.

There quickly arose the question of wherefrom the law should arise.
Those who rose to suggest that they could arbitrate themselves the division between lawfulness and crime were quickly exiled as potential tyrants, to wander the steppe in search of another city to impose themselves on.
Soon it was decided that if everyone decided how to apportion the resources and govern the land together, the law would arise naturally and fairly to all.

So they began voting, compulsively at first, with 100 percent of the city's developed people showing up to drop their ballot in the box.
First they voted on the easy questions: whether it was legal to rob, assault, or murder other people.
They were made illegal, although with only 97 percent of the vote.
People began to suspect their neighbors asking with their eyes as they walked by their porches whether they were one of the three percent; and, if they were, who they wanted to murder with impunity.

But their initial fear of their neighbors, who might just have advocated murder, robbery, assault, or all three unspeakable crimes, quickly turned to anger as the voting turned to more nuanced matters.
There were votes on the apportion of goods, the color of the currency, and whether it was obscene to wear white after the harvest.
Some people believed that the law came directly from god and that political law and religious moral law were compatible.
There were many different religions in the city that had never thought of hating one another or warring with one another until this issue came up; it took all that the more moderate citizens could do to stop them from spilling blood.
They eventually segregated themselves to opposite ends of town so that they did not have to see each other every day and wear an uncomfortable look of disgust on their faces.
There were those who thought that the goods should be apportioned to all citizens equally and those who thought that the goods should be given to those who earn them.
The first group called the second group egoists, and the second group called the first group lazy and childish while the people who no one paid any attention to wondered what they meant by "earn".

There were those who yearned for the simpler days of the tyrants when they weren't bothered with questions or ideas about public life.
There were those who denied that any government was needed, asserting instead that the natural law of things would restore order to life.
There were those who wanted to expand the city and it's borders and those who wanted to restrict population growth and isolate themselves from the rest of the world.

In the end everything was settled.
People were elected to supply the populace with referenda every five years.
People of like mindsets took over neighborhoods and conversed endlessly about the coming elections in record stores, coffee shops, bars, and piazzas.
There they discovered differences even in their similarities and new political thoughts, unlike any that had ever been thought were being outlined.
New movements rose and fell, the universalists, the alienists, the environanimalists.
Groups within groups grew and elected members to the board of referenda and the old questions were brought back up and re-decided in new ages and some were changed several times.
Drugs were legalized and then illegalized, as were assault rifles and coal.

The age of transportation came and everyone sped around the city in underground trains and aboveground cars and of course there were groups who thought that these were good things and groups that thought they were bad, and they voted accordingly.
The city shrank, but the gulfs between the people were as deep and wide as ever.
Communication continually proved dissonant.
Voting numbers dipped as a few people took their freedom for granted, so removed they were from the days of the tyrants, but turnout at the polls continued to exceed 90 percent, as the people seemed congenitally enamored with the idea of politics and suffrage.

There were so many different ideologies that in order to win a popular vote they formed coalitions.
It was almost impossible to get radical legislation passed, but it happened occasionally.
When it did the opposing group would go out and riot, overturning cars, setting fire to parks, toppling statues, and breaking windows, not in their rival's neighborhood, but where the people who stopped voting lived.
They could experience the effect of their apathy.

Once there was a land where everyone only spoke of you and me.
And we were the only ones in it.
And we realized in our last moments, the volumes that had yet to be written, and how cruel time was to give us an infinite subject and a finite span to expound it.

In the heart of the Amazonian rainforest, on the banks of the thick and powerful aorta of the jungle, there arose a metropolis of glass and brick that kept the bush at bay.
From the center spire of commerce one could see the limits of the city in the distance, as the crowded row homed lanes thinned to avenues of semi-detached houses the canopy steadily regained it's dominance until the pavement ended; abruptly surrendering to the dull brown damp earth.
There were no interstates or suburbs, no outlying villages teeming with commuters seeking school districts that their middle class sensibilities demanded.
No, the interstates that snaked their way dull white through the city center were silent and ended as abruptly as the asphalt streets when they encountered nature's dominion.
The city's center ring was impervious to the jungle's invasion.
Neither weeds nor vines cracked the pavement of the central districts.
The skyscrapers grew no vegetation on their still glossy walls, and the parks remained the same as ever, their lawns and gardens uninfiltrated by the jungle's diverse vegetation.
It seems that the city was not intrusive upon the jungle, but a natural part of the environment, as if that plot of land were so conducive to the construction of a city that apropos of nothing one appeared and could not be reclaimed by nature because it was itself natural.

The infrastructure did not suit the inhabitants' purpose.
There were no cars to heed the stop signs at intersections, or subway trains to carry the carless to their destinations.
They had the burnt sienna skin conceived in the jungle.
They were short and wore small strips of animal hide over their genitals.
In this way they pounded the city's pavement with bare feet, carried briefcases with quarterly reports in indecipherable characters up back staircases of offices, chatted in sunny parks, and played ball games on grassy fields.
Women walked topless through piazzas with naked children clipping their heels and sucking their breasts where bronze and marble monuments of unknown men on horses or in strange heavy coats pointed in all directions, marking them for development, for hope.
Students crowded the tiled halls and mosaic squares of the universities with jugs of wine on the last exam day, cavorting, dancing, singing while their professors looked down on them, equally naked, stone faced from envy and prudence or smiling wistfully.

At night everyone gathered in the gardens of the great park on the river.
The fire was lit and the flames climbed three stories.
Women and men danced in jerking motions circumscribing the fire to the beat of leather drums.
Children swam and chased each other, lovers hid themselves in the bushes, laughter echoed into the dense silence of the jungle at night.
A wizened old man, grizzled by heat and exposure, bereft of even stubs of teeth, sat on a log surrounded by a congregation and clicked out the inscrutable syllables of an unwritten epic.

There was a white walled churchless city on a long, thin promontory high over the rough sea where inhabitants fell in a constant stream from windows and lonely trees to their inevitable end for the pain of love.
It was symmetrical.
They would begin as stripling boys and girls, their sex barely distinguishable by sight, across thin, bright streets from each other.
In blanched courtyards with austere sycamore trees they played their own invented games on hot afternoons just before the birth of their memories.
Their bodies developed; they noticed their differences and for a time avoided each other, considering their physical differences awkward and irreconcilable, until they were drawn again to each other for reasons beyond their ability to comprehend.
Once again the white framed gardens were a site of worldly discovery.
They had traded in their imagined worlds (where royalty and spaceships and wargames and wide open seas were commonplace, as imaginations new to reality often dream of) for empirical experience.
They described to each other their experiences, joys, sorrows, angers, hatreds, differences with their meager adolescent vocabulary and began to understand.
The hidden corners of those open courtyards welcomed exploration, they could never tell who kissed and touched or was kissed and was touched, they would each maintain it was the other to absolve themselves of blame.
They discovered the divine purpose in their difference and intuited the awful gulf that divided and attracted them.

They shut themselves up with shame; each imagined the other to be laughing at them, closed up in their stucco rooms, crying on their beds, soaking their mattresses with vague tears.
They had been conned.
Their first loveplay with their oldest and most treasured friend, so beautiful in its conception, innocent and guileless in its execution, left the bitter aura of awkwardness around them.
They each betrayed themselves by assenting to the act and showing the other what they felt.
Each imagined that the other was simply humoring their feeling and following along in the act in order not to hurt their feelings, or perhaps they were counting the other as a feather in their cap, callous, forgetful of their former spiritual communion now seeing them as a simple vessel of pleasure.
These dehumanizing thoughts tormented them so that they avoided each other from that day forward, changing their schedules and routes so that although they were formerly inseparable and were now still only separated during sleep by stucco and a thin cobbled road barely wide enough for a tiny car, they did not catch sight of each other until they had forgotten for a moment that they were avoiding each other.

This meeting so full of late adolescent cowardice barely merits mention.
They each looked up in the street and their eyes met and shied away instantly.
They spoke stiffly and hurried on at the first pretense, glad to be out of a situation that recalled feelings so sweet and so bitter.
He talked rapidly of himself and his plans, made a sudden gesture of a revolutionary nature, and blushed; he had given himself away to the person who could see right through him.
In her presence he felt more than ever that he would never be the person he dreamt himself as.
She stared at her feet and wished him the best.
She didn't think him ridiculous; she honestly thought that he was on to great things and that it was better for him to not think of a silly girl like her who might keep him from them.

That was the time that they were about to move into the centre.
Their education would continue and their little neighborhood with the narrow alleys and blanched courtyards began to seem the stuff of childhood, sentimental but insufficient.
Their one story childhood homes were dollhouses.
They craved the activity of downtown, the rush of the city and all the people.
They each submerged each other's memory and set off through the curving avenues to the place where the alleys were so narrow a tall man couldn't lie across them, and the crowds were so dense that short women would walk for miles without knowing where they were, and there were new people to be met everyday.

At first they were disoriented, wandering around without direction or purpose being pickpocketed until some veteran took pity and directed them.
They assimilated, made friends, bustled through the crowd and took on their errands with a sense of direction and purpose, pushing past all the new comers and foreigners rolling their eyes.
They were bikers and accountants and musicians and bartenders and libertines and punks and businesspeople and yuppies and hippies and tattoo artists and politicians and writers and actors and churchgoers and lovers and hipsters and prudes and barflies and nerds.
They dated priests and whores.
They married the safe bet; they all turned into safe bets at one point of their metamorphosis.

Perhaps it's fate, but that's too easy an answer and we shall not be satisfied with a deus ex machina.
I prefer to think it's the peninsular shape of the city and the choppy currents assailing it from either side, pushing its inhabitants together in that mystical way that the sea has.
But they would meet again and recognize their mistake.
The person who they married, who they were bound to only knew their transient state.
It was no spiritual communion, but a push for security and stability in the face of their ephemeral natures.
They kept changing and their new personas would only suit them for so long because they were disingenuous to who they really were, temporary facades to stave off the realization that the only thing that could set them free was the guileless love that they deserted as children and now recognized.

But human communication is a vague echo of thought as so often we find it difficult to make ourselves understood or to take up the courage to say what we really mean.
Those prudent decisions made in a push for security became the very assailants that they were undertaken to deter.
And our couple, so mired in filial responsibility, and crushed by hopeless desire took to the lonely sycamore trees in their childhood backyards and threw themselves headlong onto the rocks below coloring the doleful tide, like tolling bells, purple.

This fate befell all those born in this city.
The children, all orphans, were raised by the ghosts of their mothers who slept in corners and watched the beginnings of their ends with wan tears.

In the city of religion our race did not last long.
The silence and the jet black asphalt of the streets called out the end to the war's lone survivor whose ideas were so removed from those of the prophet and god that he proclaimed to love, that not even the victorious heaven, streets teeming with the departed faithful, feted their conqueror.
