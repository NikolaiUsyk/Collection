## The Bishop

The bishop looked out at the congregation before him and for the first time in a long time he realized how different he was.
It was written on their eyes.
As he handed his staff and miter to the acolyte he realized that his eyes were the same as theirs too, wide open as if they never closed; open since birth like a doe's.
He remembered how when he was in the seminary, all his classmates had that same look, and he knew he was different but it never bothered him.
He knew that they had come from different circumstances; many had been born outside the city, and were unfamiliar with the kinds of realities that he knew well.
They never had any reason to doubt the existence of God; their faith was as complete as it was unchallenged.
Oh sure, there were plenty of others from harsher backgrounds, but they displayed the same unwaveringly faithful, open eyes as the others.
He always wondered how they could leave their eyes as wide open as they did, and why he couldn't.
But they never really noticed he was different, and he eventually stopped thinking about it.

He closed his eyes as he sat behind the altar after the opening hymn was sung.
It was a confirmation mass, and all he could see before him when he looked up was a large group of pre-adolescents, either twelve or thirteen, with beautifully big doe eyes.
The rest of the congregation, their parents, siblings, and friends had many different kinds of eyes, some were like his, squinty and tired, and some were as open as the children's were.
But all of the children's eyes were large and wondering with unbridled faith in what they were about to commit to.
He thought it was an odd sight to see such sureness in the eyes of children whose suits and dresses didn't fit them right.
They were at the growth spurt age, when every parent misjudges how their child is going to grow.
Some buy their children suits too big so that they'll grow into them, but they don't grow for years.
Others buy suits that fit them now and after the growth spurt is completed they'll get a new one.
These are always the ones that grow five inches in a week or two.

It occurred to him that this is the first time he had ever thought it odd for such young people to announce their conviction in Christ.
He had been a bishop for ten years, and had preformed this ritual over a hundred times.
He remembered the first one he had ever preformed.
The children looked the same as the ones before him now.
He was, wrapped in religious fervor because of their eyes.
He quoted the passage in the Gospel of Matthew as the main theme in his homily, "Truly I say to you, unless you are converted and become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
He remembered how sincere and faithful the faces were as he told them that they were chosen for the kingdom of heaven as they were, innocent and childlike.
He was really telling them never to grow up, sort of playing Peter Pan.

He couldn't really remember if he ever had eyes like that, even when he was their age.
Of course he didn't know anyone who grew up where he did, who had eyes like theirs.
When he left the seminary he served as pastor in a rural community in Central Pennsylvania.
They were so much simpler than him; their eyes were so much bigger.
They worked on their farm, they raised their cattle, they grew their corn and that was enough.
They hadn't seen what he had and their eyes remained open.
When he became a Bishop they sent him to a similar place.
His diocese was right outside of his hometown of Philadelphia, with suburbs and strip malls and small towns to visit and perform confirmations in.
The only time he went to the scattered parishes at the edge of the diocese was to perform confirmations.
Only a Bishop can perform a confirmation.
This parish was in a suburb outside of a small town with drywall houses scattered around streets with names like Pheasant Run and Painted Sky.
They all have large yards with small play sets in the back.

At first it was unfamiliar to him, as was his first parish.
He remembered his old neighborhood, the row homes, the bars, the alleyways he had played stickball in when he was as the same age as the children seated in front of him.
He remembered his father, the middle aged Irishman, right off the boat.
His father suffered from the usual immigrant ailment of not being able to keep a job, and not being able to keep out of the bars.
He was violent, but only towards his mother until she died.
She died when he was about twelve, maybe it was the beatings, maybe it was homesickness, but the doctors told them that it was because of her pregnancy.
He was about to have a little brother or sister, he was an only child.
He was desperately anxious for a companion in the household, so that he did not have to bear the brunt of his mother's tears alone.
But one night when she was pregnant for five months or so, he came home horribly drunk.
The next day she vomited blood.
He remembered the vivid redness; it was the life pouring out of her.
They took her to the hospital and she died with a child inside her.

He remembered how two weeks later his father came back drunk, with tears streaming down his face.
He dragged him out of bed and beat him fiercely.
He was only twelve and defenseless.
He cried as his father cried, and the tears mixed with his blood, until his father passed out from frustration and exhaustion.
Bruised and bloody, he rose up and ran out of the house to the McKenna's place a few blocks away.
He played stickball with their boy Patrick almost every day.
He knocked on the door at three in the morning sobbing uncontrollably.
A woman answered, it was Molly McKenna, Patrick's mother who picked him up and washed him.
She laid him in bed with the other children and he slept.

She consoled him saying, "It's alright, Edward, we'll look after you as long as need be."

His father came by the next day looking for him.
Molly told him that he was there but that he would not go back.
His father protested and tried to force his way into the house but she slapped him.
He punched her in the face and forced his way in, but Seamus, Patrick's father, caught him and dragged him into the street by his hair.
He beat him there in an uncontrollable rage.
Edward came outside just in time to see his father being beaten senseless.
He ran to him and knelt by his prostrate body, begging Seamus for clemency.

Seamus only replied, "Sit quiet laddie, it's for your own good."

He went back inside sobbing uncontrollably once again, and lay down in bed.
Seamus came in and told him that he would stay there.
They took him out that day to get a suit suitable for Sunday mass.
He remembered the first mass he was ever at, the awe that it inspired in him; the sense of holiness and the sense of God as protector and redeemer.
He had never been to church before, but there he finally felt a sense of belonging and security.
He felt hope and a solace that helped him to come to terms with his loss of father and mother.
He embraced religion; he praised God, and prayed to him every day and night.
He didn't question his faith again; it had become so deep and powerful, until he went to the seminary and saw his classmates with their wide open eyes, and he noticed his were different.

But the bishop had to cut short his reminiscing.
It was time for his homily.
He walked up to the pulpit, took the microphone and walked into the aisle, where children on either side of him craned their necks and focused their doe-eyes upon him.
He started off his homily in a failsafe way by explaining to everyone the reason for confirmation as given in the catechism.
He explained how these young adults, he felt odd calling them adults, as they were barely reaching puberty, were going to be initiated into the community not only as members of a parish, but as soldiers of Christ, and defenders of the faith.
They were to be infused with the blood of the martyrs, in an age old tradition that conjures up the mysteries of the early church, they were soldiers ready and willing to spread and defend Catholicism to the ends of the Earth.
He explained how this is what the solemn sacrament of confirmation is meant to do.
He had never imagined any of the previous children he had confirmed as soldiers, and the words had always fallen off his tongue, without much thought.
This time he almost choked back the word martyr when he imagined the little girl in the front row with a white hat and bow with a rose on it, to be initiated into the church in the same way as a martyr who was thrust into the ring with a lion.

He decided to drop the martyr comparisons; he had always used them and never thought about it that much.
He thought there must be something odd about this particular mass, but he couldn't put his finger on what it was.
He decided instead to talk about how this was a special sacrament also because of the gifts that the Holy Spirit was to bestow upon those to be confirmed.
He explained how the Holy Spirit was to make the children soldiers for Christ, and to endow in them all the attributes that they will need to go out into the world as witnesses to the kingdom of Heaven.
The Holy Spirit, which is the manifestation of the love between God the Father and God the Son, was to descend upon the congregation that evening and convert these young adults into solid Catholic men and women, who would go into the world and spread the love, faith, and eternal life that was to be found in the Church and the teachings of Christ.
He thought by this time his speech had become rather vague and too theological for the audience.
He had started improvisating most of it, after he felt odd talking about the children as being prepared for martyrdom.
He ended his speech with relief, and went on to the customary question and answer session.

He started off by asking, "Who here can tell me how many sacraments there are?"
Almost all the children raised their hands, this was an easy one.

He picked the little girl in the first row, with the rose ribbon on her white hat.
Her eyes were so innocent and full of wonder when she looked at him.
He gave her the microphone and she said, "Bishop, there are seven sacraments."

He took the microphone back and said, "Very good, we should all know the sacraments before we celebrate them.
Now does anyone know what is used to anoint in the sacrament of confirmation?"

All the hands went up again and he went over to the boys' side.
He picked a shorter boy in the second row, whose suit had obviously been bought in anticipation of a substantial growth spurt that hadn't come.
He took the microphone and said, "Bishop, Chrism is used to anoint in the sacrament of confirmation."

"Good."
The bishop replied.
"Now can you tell me what chrism is?"

A look of consternation passed over the boy's face as he tried to recall the answer.
He took the microphone and answered the question, not thinking about what chrism is, but trying to remember the answer he had recited so many times in class and at home.
He started, "Bishop, chrism is a blessed mixture of oil and balm used during the baptismal ceremony, in confirmation, ummm..."
He paused and looked up at the bishop, squinting his huge white eyes; he regained himself, "during the ordination of priests and bishops, and in the consecration of churches, altars and other things."

The Bishop took the microphone back and said, "That was a very hard question, and a very good answer.
Ok.
Now can anyone tell me about the gifts of the Holy Spirit?
This is important because it is what you are about to receive today from this sacrament."
This time fewer hands went up.
The bishop looked around until his eyes were caught by a hand whose arm was uncovered about six inches below his wrist.
Here was the inverse of the previous child, this one had a growth spurt, but his parents had not planned on it, and his suit was a few sizes too small.
He went up to the boy and asked him his name; the boy replied that it was Michael.
He said, "Well Michael, do you know what the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit are?"

The boy lifted his head up and with an almost clairvoyant look in his very large eyes, took the microphone and said, "Bishop, the gifts of the Holy Spirit are wisdom, understanding, right judgment, courage, knowledge, piety, and holy fear.
But Bishop, I cannot understand why we would have a fear of what is holy, or what sort of fear would be holy.
A God that loves us so much would not want us to be afraid, or to fear what was his."
He said it as calmly as if he had stated a simple fact like "two plus two is four."
The bishop was dumbfounded.
In his all the time he had preformed or witnessed confirmation masses, he had never seen a child deviate from the catechism definitions to say some thing original as this boy did.
The bishop was so shocked that he paused for about five seconds until, unperturbed, the boy went on, "Bishop, don't worry, God loves you, he loves us all, we need not stand in fear of him.
I accept my calling as a soldier of Christ, and I will do whatever it takes to defend my faith."
He said this without a hint of nervousness or insincerity.
The bishop had recovered himself by then and received the microphone back from the boy.

"Michael," he said, "you are a true soldier of Christ.
I hope your classmates are all strong enough to speak with such conviction.
And I hope that you cherish this sacrament, and all that it will bring you."
He smiled a weak smile and went back to the altar to continue the mass.

He couldn't stop looking at Michael for the rest of the mass.
His impenetrable calmness, and his wide eyes, willing to accept whatever the world gives him, were captivating, and they made the bishop realize how different he really was, inherently.
He confirmed the group and ended the mass.
He had his pictures taken with families after mass at the reception.
He didn't see Michael there.

He went back to the cathedral and sat in his room there until he fell asleep thinking about what Michael said.
He told him not to worry, but he was worried.
He worried that this was all wrong; that he did not have a fraction of the faith that this child did.
He couldn't have that faith because his eyes squinted and hid from the world.
He had defense mechanisms and fear of the world.
He knew that things were hurtful, and he did not want to be hurt.
His eyes did not open like the children's did.
One day many of their eyes may be like his but he knew that Michael's wouldn't.
The intransigence of those eyes could not be conquered, their peace and faith were boundless, and he was only a twelve year old boy.
Michael should be the bishop not him; his eyes betrayed his lack of pure faith.

He remembered his early priesthood.
After the seminary he had grown accustomed to the large eyes of his parishioners.
He had graduated at the head of his class, and had always been very intelligent.
He never really felt like part of the community in any of his parishes though.
He wondered if that betrayed his lack of faith, his inability to be really accepted in the community of believers.
He felt like an outsider looking in wherever he went, like he was a different kind of person than his parishioners.
He was made a bishop because of his exceptional intelligence and the fact that he didn't mind being bishop.
Almost all the other priests, tried as hard as they could to stay priests because they liked being involved in their small community.
He was never really a part of a community so he didn't mind losing his position in the parish community to become a bishop.

When he said the confirmation mass that day, he wished he was a priest at that church, instead of a bishop.
He would have loved to be around someone like Michael in a community; it wouldn't matter if he was an outsider to the rest of the parish.
He just wanted to know someone who was so pure and holy a little better.
He wondered what would happen to Michael in the world.
Maybe he'd be a priest, but he'd never want to be a bishop.
If he became a priest he'd be so content with being a part of the community, because he would be part of the community.
He wondered if he'd be ok, there's so much that this world can do to a young person.
He wondered if he would stay pure.
He found out about him a few days later.

Michael had gotten into the van with his parents after the mass; they skipped the reception because his younger brother was tired.
His parents asked him why he had said what he said.
He replied that he had only told the bishop what he needed to be told and that it was all true.
His parents accepted that answer; they had never got angry at their son for speaking his mind; he never did it violently or superfluously.
They knew he was different from other kids because of the way he spoke, but he didn't mind being different.
He was a special kid; he seemed to be able to sense exactly what needed to be said at a crucial moment and say it in his always calm and sincere demeanor.

As they were driving away from the church, Michael spoke up again, "You know, God loves us all, even when something bad happens to us.
It's his will, but He loves us.
So don't give up on Him, even if something bad happens."
His parents told him that was a very nice thing to say and that God would be pleased with him for sharing it.
Just then they crossed an intersection.
Their light was green, but as they were midway through a pickup truck broadsided their van.
It hit the side that Michael was sitting on.
The truck drove through sliding the door and hit Michael directly; it killed him instantly.
The rest of the family was only marginally injured.
The father suffered a broken arm and leg, the mother, only whiplash and scratches, the younger son was completely unscathed, as his child's car seat kept him tightly in place.
The driver of the truck was not seriously injured, he wasn't drunk or high, just inattentive.

The funeral was held three days later.
The bishop insisted on performing the ceremony, he had not been able to stop thinking about Michael since the confirmation, and had wept when he heard of his death.
The entire elementary school was at the mass, including all the parents of the students.
They each wore a black ribbon on their uniform for the mourning.
The family wore black as well and sat in front.
The bishop watched them and couldn't understand why the mother cried the entire time.
He had cried for Michael initially, but then he realized that he was in heaven.
How could he not be, the unobstructed, pure faith that he had, and those doe-eyes.
They guaranteed him a place in celestial paradise.
But after the bishop realized this he cried even harder, he had begun to wonder where his place in heaven would be, with eyes that sagged and closed.
