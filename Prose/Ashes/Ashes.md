## Ashes

When Brian was 9 years old his mother died.
The light green funeral home room was covered in fresh flowers surrounding the casket where she lay pale and immobile.
He wasn't sure if it was actually her; it didn't look much like her.
Perhaps they were at the wrong place dressed in starched black for a person they never knew.
His relatives poured into the room, propelled there by planes, cars and grief with wet eyes ready to leek.
He stood in line in front of the chairs against the walls of the room with his older brothers and his father as they poured in.
When the women saw her lying motionless they wailed; the men dropped their heads.
They shook or hugged his father and moved on down the line.
When they came to him, the women cried louder and hugged him to their breast; the men squinted on their wet eyes and called him a real trooper with lips and voices that shook like dried leaves in the wind.
They were most affected when they looked at Brian not only because of the tragedy of losing a mother at such a tender age, but mostly because of his stoic manner.
His eyes were the driest in the room; he appeared to be completely calm.
Most of them had not seen the family in years and figured that Brian was slow and did not understand what had happened.

The soft-eyed priest gave a short speech at the funeral home before they adjourned to the chapel across the street.
He spoke in a halting, uncertain voice about Joan's new life in heaven, where Jesus knelt at her feet and washed them before dinner, where she was feasted with all her favorite foods and was loved by all, especially Jesus and God the Father.
Most of the mourners thought it was a bit much, that this fantasy afterlife was all fine and pleasant to fill child's minds with, but it was a bit much for an adult to stomach let alone believe.
Some, the oldest son in particular who roasted the priest with a look of fiery contempt as he spoke, thought that such foolishness was not simply a misguided fantasy and a refusal to accept the reality of death, but also a direct insult to the memory of the dead.
Brian was shocked at the use of his mother's Christian name.
To him she was always mom never Joan; he wondered again if they were at the right funeral.
When he decided that they were at the right funeral, he began to wonder about how his mother had a whole separate life, apart from him where she was not mom, but a completely different woman, a Joan.
The priest trailed off, and everyone walked across the street to the church in the brisk October air.
That morning had yielded the first frost and now the sun was out melting the frozen dew, wetting the grass and the air.
The air was thicker and warmer when they left the church and snaked through the country in their caravan of cars.
Brian wondered why the roads curved so much when there was so much room.
The field to his left was always empty and overgrown, why did they have to drive around it?
The procession made its way to the cemetery.
Everyone was exhausted from weeping so much so no tears were shed on her fresh grave.
They lowered her into the ground and the priest read something from a missal that no one paid attention to, save Brian's oldest brother who was shooting a withering look at the priest.
The dirt was moist and the grass was shimmering with melted frost and the fog was fading and the sky was deep blue dappled with white cumulus clouds.
Brian closed his eyes.
Whenever they returned to that spot Brian thought not of his mother but of that day.

Two days later when Brian was sent back to school his teacher, Sister Mary Joseph, informed the class of his mother's passing.
Some of his classmates, his closer friends and those whose parents were close to his, had been at the funeral or had already been informed of her death.
They had grieved at her funeral, but Brian had not noticed them there, so caught up was he in the mood of the day.
Now they sat and looked down at their desks or gave him swift glances of sympathy having already mourned his loss at the funeral and having nothing else to add to their grief were able to do nothing else but sympathize and leave the rest up to the almighty figure that they had been taught to believe in since they could remember, first as the gentle long-haired man in the white tunic with a lamb on his lap addressing a semi-circle of children on the cover of the plastic bound book titled: God is good.
The rest of the class reacted with dismay; although this event was foreseeable a good portion of the class erupted in tears while the others assumed a serious, thoughtful, melancholy countenance and stared ahead of them in wonder at death's existence.
The teacher admonished the class and told them to settle down, reassuring them all that Brian's mother was in a better place with God and all the Saints because she was a good woman and if they all were good people as well they would all go to Heaven as well, where nothing bad ever happened.
They quieted down and said a rosary for the soul of his mother.
As Brian was finishing the Glory Bee the lunch bell struck with his Amen, and his classmates remembered their stomachs.
They filed out of the room, some of them talking animatedly to the consternation of Sister Mary Joseph, with the usual expressions on their faces.
Their grief was gone, easily washed away with the next period, but Brian didn't feel he needed them to be sad for him; he closed his eyes.

Brian met the soft-eyed priest three months before his mother died.
He was a childhood friend of his mother's and was transferred to their parish at that time.
At that time his mother was living at the hospital, losing her battle.
She was the same color as the antiseptic walls, her voice was weak and breaking, and her hair was so wispy that he could see her scalp.
The priest was shy and his presence made the room a bit awkward, like a loose acquaintance showing up first at a party.
His black clothes stood out from the whiteness of his mother and the room itself, as a premonition of mourning.
His expression only reinforced that premonition.
Brian was left alone in the room with his mother and the priest, and his mother called him to her.
He pushed aside the IV tube and pushed himself up on the side of her bed.
She smelled sterile; she used to smell like lilac.
Her breath was decay.
Brian began to sob, but she shushed him before he could hiccough and said, "Brian, I love you very much.
But you know.
I'm going away."
She pronounced these last words with much difficulty.
She teared up, but as he began to sob she shushed him again and said softly, nodding her head, "But I need you to understand something, honey, because I love you, and I want you to know that this isn't going to separate us.
You won't see me anymore...
after awhile, but I'll be fine.
I'm going to a better place.
But you can still talk to me there.
Okay, honey.
I'll still be with you, all you need to do is put your hands together like this," she put her palms flat together, fingers closed, facing up, "and close your eyes, and we'll be able to talk just like we're talking now, okay."
She nodded more with tears bursting forth and clutched him to her saying, "Oh, honey."
They cried, and the priest was there in a chair across the room looking at his feet.

----

From then on, whenever Brian was feeling alone or pious or bored he would close his eyes and point his fingers to the sky and in the infinite space between his eyes and his eyelids he would meet his mother, glowing white as she had been before the cancer attacked her, and talk to her.
He told her that he won the Spelling bee, and she was so proud of him.
He told her when he was sad and she reassured him with motherly advice.
He told her about the family, and she told him that she prayed for them all.
She told him that God was very nice and very tall with a great beard and that Jesus was so peaceful and beautiful that everyone around him was always happier than they had ever been before.
She told him how happy she was there and said that he would join her there with his father and brothers when the time came, which was hopefully a very long time from then.
He asked why she wouldn't want them to be with her sooner, and she answered that life was a great gift and that she would trade where she was now to be back with them.
Overall, he thought she seemed happy.

----

After his mother's death Brian's father became unavailable, immersing himself in his business.
When Brian began to change, as his voice cracked, and acne broke out on his face he went to his mother for advice about his changing body and his new urges.
She told him that his bodily change wouldn't last forever and gave him the Church's line on his burgeoning sexuality saying that while impure thoughts might be an unavoidable sin, impure actions were not.
She told him that if he wanted to be with her one day in Heaven he would have to not act on those urges until he was married.
That sexuality against God's law was wrong; he would have to wait until marriage and he would have to only have urges toward girls, never boys.
He had heard this advice before, from the pulpit at mass and from his teachers in school who were attempting to prepare their classes for young adulthood, but coming from his mother who had met God personally it had more resonance in his young mind.

It was at this time, three years after his mother's death when Brian was in the sixth grade, that the soft-eyed priest began coming to his class once a week to educate them about their bodily changes and newfound desires.
Brian had seen the priest on occasion since his mother's death, when the family decided to go to church they would shake hands with him in the vestibule and the priest and his father would force conversation.
When the others weren't there he would pat Brian's head and ask if he had been hearing from his mother lately, and Brian would tell him that he talked to her every day.
It was their little secret, only the soft-eyed priest knew of his correspondence with his departed mother.

The sexual education classes that the priest taught were not a roaring success.
He was awkward and tripped over his words in front of the class.
The intimate setting was not his forte; there was nothing to separate himself from the crowd as there was when he was preaching at mass on Sunday.
And when confronted with a room full of twelve year old boys the old trick that he sometimes employed of imagining everyone in their underwear seemed inappropriate.
In February of that year the inevitable happened, the class clown raised his hand in the middle of the priest's discourse on abstinence that he gave a variation of every week and asked:

"Father, when is it ok to have sex?"

"When you're married then you can have sex."

"Well, Father, when did you first have sex?"

"Well, I...
um, no I've never had sex."

At this admission the class roared with laughter, and the clown spoke up again, "Well if you've never had sex how can you teach us about when to do it and what our desires are, do you even know how to have sex?"

The priest was already stuttering and fighting to talk while the clown challenged him.
He answered like a pizza faced eighteen year old, "I have too had sex."
He recovered himself, "I mean no; no I haven't had sex.
Because I knew that it was a mortal sin, and I didn't want that on my soul and neither do you.
Sex is a gift from God, and we must use God's gifts according to his design.
I know how to have sex because I've read about it and seen pictures."
At this the class burst out laughing again at the class clown's instigation.

"You've read about it?"
He asked, laughing his head off, "You're a virgin.
A virgin teaching us about sex."

"Hey, everyone quiet down," his authoritative posture wasn't working.
Pre-teens can smell weakness in their teachers.
"As you well know, ahem, as you well know, as a priest in the Catholic Church I've taken a vow of celibacy which means that I can't marry and can't have sex.
So fine, I'm a virgin."

"Did you always want to be a virgin then?
Don't you still have the desires that you're supposed to be teaching us about?
How can you forget about them?"

He looked around the room unable to produce an answer.
The class was staring at him, suppressing their giggles and he didn't know what to say.
Of course he still had desires; he was human.
But if he admitted it like he admitted his virginity, it'd lead to a whole new set of questions away from the lesson and toward his embarrassment and emasculation.
Their eyes were on him, and he found Brian's eyes in the back of the classroom; they gave him no sympathy, no quarter.

Brian sat around the kitchen table surrounded by the pristine kitchen of immaculate countertops, ranges, and hanging pots and pans that hadn't been used in three years silently eating his microwave dinner with his father and brothers.
His father finished quickly and left for work again leaving Brian and his brothers to finish their dinners and put the plastic containers in the trash.
His oldest brother, Adam, asked him how school was and Brian said it was fine.
He mentioned the incident with the soft-eyed priest, Father Andrew, and his oldest brother laughed his head off.

"Oh, that poor, pathetic son of a bitch," he said, "he's a virgin.
That's terrific, I suppose he went to become a priest to get an excuse for never getting laid.
Why are you such a looser Andrew?
Well, I have an excuse, I took vows."

"How can you put him down when he was always by mom's side?
He's always been nice to us.
What the hell would you have against him?"
His older brother Steve said.

"Did you hear the crap he was spouting at her funeral?
It was offensive.
God and Jesus floating on white clouds behind pearly gates with feasts for the righteous.
What kind of fairy tale is that?
And God has a big white beard, and Jesus has long brown hair and a light tunic on.
And Santa Claus slides down the chimney as a magician pulls the Easter Bunny out of a hat with the Tooth Fairy.
It's mind numbingly stupid.
That sort of tripe can be swallowed until you're eight but after that anyone with a brain can see through it."

Brian was unsettled by this tirade.
He ventured, "But God does have a big white beard and he's very tall.
And Jesus has long brown hair."

This sent Adam into a fit of the giggles.
"Ok Brian.
How do you know this?
Have you met the big man then?
Or are you just thinking that the pictures on the cover of your religion book are the absolute truth?
Come on, the big tall guy with the beard is just a parental archetype of a specific culture."
Brian looked confused at this, so Adam added, "Forget that, just ask yourself.
What color is God's skin?
All the pictures have him as being white, but isn't that because this God's religion was started by white people.
If Christianity were started in China, God would look Asian.
Who told you what God looked like anyway?
Was it that Father Andrew?
Man!
That guy is just ridiculous.
He knows what God looks like.
Ha."

His brother's reasoning confused Brian who hadn't really thought about any of that before.
But he heard it from the horse's mouth; their mother told him that it was like that so it must be true.
She would know, being up there.
So he said, "No God really does look like that; I don't know if he's white or not, but I could ask next time."

"Ask who?
That fraud, Father Andrew."

"Shut up, Adam."
Steve interjected.

"No, mom," they all stopped for a second.
"Mom told me that God was like that, and she would know because she's with Him."

Adam stared at Brian for a second before asking him thoughtfully, "So you've talked to mom?
When?"

"I dunno, about two times a week I talk to her, sometimes more when we go to church a lot.
I always talk to her in church and sometimes when I just want to talk to her."

"I talk to her too."
Steve said swiftly.

"Oh Christ, are you serious?
Ok, Brian, when you talk to mom, what does she sound like?
Does she sound like she did before she got sick, you remember her strong voice don't you?
Or does she sound like she did when she couldn't get out of bed, whispering to us from her hospital bed?
What does she sound like?"

"She talks like she used to before she got sick."

"Ah, so it's the old mom that's in heaven, before she got sick.
Where do you think the mom that was sick is?
Is she the same person?
When you die do you go on as the person you died as or who you were before you died?"

Brian's head was spinning, "I dunno."

"Right, of course you don't.
And neither do I, but before you go taking advice from our late mother, think.
Think, have I thought of this before, or learned this piece of information yesterday?
You might be answering your questions yourself or using a piece of information that you just picked up as an answer to the question.
It's all in your head; you could be imagining talking to mom when you're really talking to yourself."

"But mom told me before she died that she'd be able to talk to me after she left."

"Couldn't she have been wrong?
She wasn't right about everything.
She missed that cancer until it was too late, thought it was just a mole or something.
You know, and now she's in the ground, decomposing.
And she's no where else, not heaven or hell because they don't..."

"That's enough, Adam."
Steve cut him off.
"We've heard enough of your point of view if you wanna call it that."

"Sure, damn.
I need a cigarette."

Adam's words were on Brian's mind that week as the school filed into the chapel for Ash Wednesday mass.
He knelt down with everyone else and closed his eyes looking for his mother.
She spoke to him, but she spoke in her sick voice which came from her in hushed fits when she lay on the white bed in the hotel room.
He asked her if she was the way she was when she was sick or if she was the way she was before when she was healthy now that she was in Heaven.
She answered that everyone in Heaven is how they were when they were happiest.
He asked why she sounded so weak this time.
She went back to the old stand by; she told him how much she loved him.
This had always pacified him, but now it made him think, wasn't this just what he wanted to hear.
Hadn't she always told him what he wanted to hear, the answer that made the most sense to him?
Wasn't everything she said, already something that he knew, or thought of first?
Adam's words were ringing in his head as the mass started, and the soft-eyed Father Andrew processed down the aisle to the back of the altar, kissing the relic first.
The mass started and Brian fell to thinking.
She seemed happy, but he wanted her to be happy.
Was that voice really hers, the strong one that she had always talked with when he closed his eyes?
He couldn't even remember what she sounded like five years ago before she got sick.
He couldn't remember what she looked like either; his memory was all fuzzy.
She changed in his mind since she died, each day as he tried to remember he remembered someone different.
She changed imperceptibly so that he couldn't tell where it had started, but he knew that he wasn't remembering correctly.
Was he just imagining her voice and putting the words of the church, or his own opinions into her mouth?
He had never disagreed with anything she said to him.
It was always something he expected her to say.
He challenged her to say something unexpected when he closed his eyes, but he couldn't.
Maybe she couldn't talk to him because she didn't go to Heaven.
He couldn't accept the horror of that thought so he decided that Adam might be right, she's turned to ash, decomposed underground.
He can't talk to her; she doesn't exist anymore.

Father Andrew came up to the center aisle and began to distribute the ashes onto the congregation's forehead to set them apart as believers, but Brian didn't want to be set apart.
He didn't want to belong or not to belong to these groups; groups are all about repetition, mouthing the same dogma over and over again.
Jesus died for us; I love you very much Brian.
There's nothing new, so he swung his legs up onto the pew and let his classmates go by to get their ashes.
He would remain unmarked with the remains of the dead.
He had enough to remind him of his mortality.
His clean forehead stood out among all the dirty ones as the priest sat back down behind the altar.
His eyes met Brian's.
Brian thought about how sad it must be for a priest, married to a man already dead.
The priest simply sighed.
