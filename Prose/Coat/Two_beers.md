## Two beers

My most vivid memory of the immediate event is also the haziest.
It's barely a memory; it's an impression.
Immediately after I had come to I saw what appeared to be a past ripe tomato but was actually a woman's face.
Even as I made out, through the line of Market Street lamps, the outline of city hall in the distance and felt the fresh pain surging through my head; my only thought was how odd it was that my first conscious thought was: your face looks like a rotting tomato.
And I think it did, although I don't know how reliable my memories of the incident are.
I was badly injured and the unity of my impression probably has more to do with imagination than reality, anyway, the face looked like a rotting tomato because its cheeks were flushed raw red with exhaustion and panic on a humid summer night in old city, but the bright red of the cheeks was creased hard with middle aged lines like a tomato's skin beginning to pull away from the pulp, and faded at the temples and nose into the natural dark brown skin color of the middle aged black woman standing over my sprawled body leaning against a lamppost.
She wore thin glasses with a strap around the back of her neck like a grandmother, short hair spiked with bright red tips, like quills dipped in blood, and a bus driver's grey-blue vertically striped uniform.
I guess she had been trying to wake me up because a few seconds, which seemed like a few minutes, after I opened my eyes she let out a deep breath and whispered, "Finally, thank God."

"Honey, you gotta stay awake for me now."
She squeezed my cheeks with her warm, fleshy hands, holding my wandering eyes on hers; I wanted to close them again.
"You're hurt pretty bad now, honey.
The ambulance is coming any minute now."
She was gasping.
"I called..."

"No hospital, no hospital, no insurance."
I was surprised that I was unable to express myself.
I sort of blurted out those words for fear of the hospital.
Bankruptcy and bad memories.
What good memories could be had in hospitals anyway?

"Well how silly is that now, a grown man, must be 30 damn years old with no health insurance.
You a damn fool boy.
You're definitely gonna need the hospital with that hole in your head.
That ain't gonna close up all by itself now."

I felt it without touching it when she mentioned it.
A part of my body that had never felt the open air was now brushing against it, painfully.
I felt that side of my face with my fingers, wet and sticky.
I blinked, and my eyelids stuck closed like I had just woken from a twelve hour sleep.
Panic welled, but instead I tried to get up and just forget the whole thing, walk home, get to bed like I wanted to before and let everyone else take care of it, but I fell when I got halfway up.
She caught me before I bit the pavement and set me back up against the lamppost.
She caught a whiff of me and asked indignantly, "Have you been drinking?"

Well yeah I had been, not a lot, but that's why I was in the back of a cab going home.
What the hell is wrong with having a few drinks after work and getting in a cab or a bus?
That's why these public services that you trust implicitly to take your from place to place for a bit of money without complication exist.
I couldn't say that, so I stared at her blankly for a few seconds.
She softened her expression and leant in confidentially, "You saw it was him who ran that red light, didn't you honey?"

She hadn't said it softly enough.
He was sitting against his totaled taxi ten yards away.
The front left corner was crushed, and it had been spun around 180 degrees onto the sidewalk where, amazingly, no pedestrians had been.
There wasn't anyone in the bus when it hit the cab.
It two stops from the end, last line of the night.
The sidewalk was crowded; the bars were just letting out.
Most of the people who saw the incident and some of those who had been nearby congregated around the three of us in a semi-circle like they were listening to a tour guide.
They were chattering amongst themselves, exchanging astonished and sympathetic glances, covering open mouths with their hands.
My glazed eyes scanned them, I'm sure of it.
No doctors emerged.

The cab driver and the bus driver were arguing beside me.
As the night came back to me I regretted everything with flawless hindsight.
Why did I get in that taxi?
I should have walked home like I was going to do, but the bartender didn't charge me for any drinks, professional courtesy.
Why cut the night short?
I slipped him a twenty and put my hand up on the sidewalk.
I had a long shift, tiring, and it would have taken me almost an hour to walk.
It pulled up immediately, and I got in even though I had a bad feeling about it, mostly because it felt frivolous.
The driver had the same color and texture as the ancient burnt umber leather seats in the backseat; he could have been any age at all.
He didn't speak.
He seemed like an extension of the upholstery itself.
I imagined his body as metal wire veins and pale yellow fiberglass cushion muscle covered in wrinkled leather skin.
He was shouting broken English at the bus driver who was staring at him, her eyes growing angrier and angrier.
She was waiting for the right point to break in and let loose with her undammable verbal assault, well-practiced over 40 something years.

It was both of their faults.
I was leaning up to instruct the driver who was turning right when I thought we should turn left, but then he turned right anyway just as the light had turned red, but before the other light had turned green.
They both ran the red light, but one of them, since they drive vehicles for a living, should have been aware enough to stop when they saw the other.
The cab driver probably should have stopped, buses generally being able to inflict more damage on cabs than vice versa.
He was fine because of his airbag and seatbelt but without any seatbelt and leaning through the open partition, now a guillotine, I was in pretty bad position.
I feel culpable for distracting him, but if he would have just listened to me he would have waited for the next light and turned the other way anyway.

They started really getting into it, accusations flew, then insults, first about driving ability then about each other's ethnicities.
The crowd was agape, some people tittered.
If one of them had a first aid kit with some gauze in their vehicle; that might have helped the bleeding.
I didn't hear any sirens, which was puzzling because the hospital was only a few blocks away.
I scanned the faces in the crowd again.
I gave a sort of helpless smile, but everyone just stared at me or at the arguing drivers like a street performance.
When I met someone's eyes they looked away, and once a few people left disinterested I saw men wrapping their arms around women's waists, whispering "Let's go, we'll be late," in their ears.
What were they going to be late for at two in the morning?

The crowd thinned, and I found what I was looking for in their collective face, a familiar one.
I know a lot of people around here.
I'm a damn bartender.
Everyone who goes out in Philadelphia, especially in this neighborhood, has been served a drink and amiable chit chat by me.
I thought that I would know everyone on this street at this time and perhaps someone would give me a hand or show some concern.
I was disappointed until Chris walked by.
Of course he looked over to see what the commotion was.
He was with a couple of people, guys and girls, but when he saw me sitting there he pushed through the thin line of spectators that were still semicircular around me and the ongoing accented din of the drivers' argument.

"Holy shit, Cory.
What the hell happened?"

"Cab."
I smiled woozily and nodded to the crushed yellow vehicle.

"Oh man, un-fucking-believable!
You think you're safe eh?
Jesus, look at your head, are you going to the hospital."

"Ambulance coming, no insurance.
Ok.
No help, ok.
Walk it off."
I tried to stand up, and he helped me up by my elbow.
I was on my feet, but I couldn't balance.

"I dunno Cor.
You've probably got a concussion or something.
You're standing like you're drunk as hell."

"One or two, that's why damn cab!"

"What?
Yeah.
I mean, I wasn't saying that.
I just mean you're stumbling."

"Oh,"

"Dude, you better wait for that ambulance.
You've gotta get that shit sewn up.
And I think you've got a concussion.
If you go home and start sleeping you could die, seriously, die.
Wait for the ambulance.
It won't cost too much for the hospital, and plus, you can sue someone's ass for this.
We're goin over to the P&P to catch some after hours shit.
Wish you could come with, but I'd say that's a bad idea at the moment."
He chuckled a bit at himself, and I almost fell over.
"Whoa there Cor.
Let's set you back down here.
Yeah, lean against that pole.
Man, I'll come in to see you at work on Wednesday, alright, got a new girl to bring round I met tonight.
She's fuckin' smokin' dude.
Bet you'll have a hell of a story.
Later Cory."

He jogged away.
The crowd had left, and I noticed the sirens behind the cab spinning silent red and blue.
Ambulance sirens are red and red, this was a police car.
The two policemen separated the arguing drivers and sat them twenty yards away from each other on the curb to take their statements I guess.
I was still sitting against the lamppost, mutely watching them work, suspecting that someone would come over and give me some gauze or something.
Finally, a minute or two after they showed up, a policeman came over to me with his arms akimbo looking sternly down at me, my head no higher than his knee.
I think he thought I was a bum.
As he was about to speak I raised my head, and he changed his expression, "Holy shit, are you alright?
We're you involved in this accident?"
As if he couldn't see the blood on my face before, I was sitting under the goddamned streetlight.
At the time I was just happy that someone seemed concerned, and I glanced at the cab.
"Let me see your eyes."
He crouched over me shining a flashlight in my eyes and on my left temple.
"Yeah, that's a concussion alright.
I can't believe we just stumbled upon this, no one called 911 or anything."
I knew she was lying.
"I've got a first aid kit in the car.
I'll go get something to put on that wound."
Thank Christ.
Before he went back to his car he took out his walkie-talkie and asked for a bus.
I didn't want to get into anything that anyone would call a bus, but as my previous attempts at standing were failures I didn't have much of a choice.

He came back with rubbing alcohol, gauze, tape, and a towel.
He put some rubbing alcohol on a cotton swab and said, "Now this might hurt a bit."
I didn't reply, and it didn't hurt.
He helped put the gauze on my wound and the medical tape around my head.
He asked me if I remembered what happened as he soaked up the blood on my face with the towel.
I told him I couldn't remember much because I didn't want to speak.
He asked me if I could stand up, and I told him that it was difficult.
He told me to sit tight while the ambulance came and went over to interrogate the cab driver.

The ambulance never came and for about fifteen minutes I was left sitting alone on the pavement in the middle of the night.
But I didn't really think about much, or if I did I can't remember it.
I felt guilty for the way I reacted when Chris said I seemed drunk.
I was so disoriented and woozy that I couldn't string coherent thoughts together.
But the blurry thoughts that floated through my head sent up waves of undefined awful feelings in my chest.
I felt out of place in a place that had been home for so long.
I felt like the subject of some sick joke or secret ridicule.
I hadn't felt like that in a really long time.
It was like being invited to a party just so that everyone could ignore you and chuckle, "I can't believe he actually showed up," behind your back as you left humiliated.
It was the strangest thing.
That feeling stuck in my gut even as my head was as blank as it had ever been, as blank as the city sky, as blank as nirvana.

The cop who fixed me up with the gauze stood up after questioning the cab driver and looked back at me absentmindedly.
I smiled at him, and he stared at me incredulously.
He came over and said that it shouldn't be taking this long for them to get here when the hospital was only a few blocks away.
He called his partner over; they conferred and decided that he would take me to the ER while the other stayed and waited for the tow truck which was also taking far too long to appear.
So he took me under the shoulder and helped me to my feet, anyone walking up from behind me would have thought I was getting arrested, but even this street was deserted by now.
I stumbled a bit and bumped into him.
I guess he caught a bigger whiff of me than he wanted because he straightened up, looked me in the eyes, and asked sternly:

"Have you been drinking?"

Well I have a right to have been haven't I?
A long day of work, and you have a drink or two and get into a cab to take you home, right?
I didn't get into this mess by being irresponsible and getting into my own car blind drunk and running into a telephone pole on a crowded street, did I?
No, I was acting responsibly, so it's no one's fucking business whether I was drinking or not.
There's so much illegal about drinking it's a wonder we're all still not in speakeasies.
But even in my state of blankness I knew enough not to give a police officer any reason to react.
So instead I sort of mumbled, "No."
And then by way of explanation, "I'm bartender 'round corner, spilled beer."

He accepted my excuse but continued to look at me warily, leading me to the police car.
He sat me in back, there's too much sensitive equipment on the passenger dashboard, and I wasn't exactly in control of my movements.
Behind bars I rode to the emergency room where he dropped me off after leading me to the door.
I suppose he expected some white clad nurses to come rushing out and take me off to a room where they would fix me up, but none came.
When he had jumped into his car and left me on the other side of the double paned Plexiglas automatic doors in the perpetual daylight of the emergency waiting room I was almost alone.

I can see myself now, squinting from the bald fluorescence, limping with a bandage over half of my left temple and blood all over the top of my shirt, through the waiting room where a few scattered invalids were dozing or sifting through outdated magazines disinterestedly.
I was feeling really faint by the time I arrived at the counter.
I sort of slumped over it, but there was no one there.

There were the normal hospital sounds, wheels rolling over industrial tile, errant pages from hallway phones calling doctors to discreet rooms, the blips and boops of medical machines.
I was lightheaded and tired, from my injuries and the fact that I had been ready to head to bed before the crash.
There was a door behind the desk, and I thought I heard some laughter coming from inside.
I thought I was hallucinating, but then I heard it again, clearer.
It made me very self-conscious; someone must be laughing at me from behind the door.
The staff must have gotten the call from the dispatcher and decided to wait for the police to bring me in.
It was a joke, they decided among themselves that they weren't going to do anything, just watch me stumble around and bleed.
I was almost too crushed to feel anger.
I was about to scream, "Help me!
Help me you heartless bastards!"
When I heard a television being turned up from behind the door, its tinny speakers blurted out a man's voice, "Now, Linda, this is real hard for me you know, but there's something I have to tell you."
An audience gasped heavily at this, and someone behind the door chuckled.
"I know you're my wife and all, but I've been sleeping with your brother."

The voices in the room erupted with laughter, and the television audience went into a frenzy, shouting, gasping, laughing, clapping.
"Oh Mark," a woman's voice replied, "are you...
gay?"

They laughed even harder at this and a woman in the room yelled, "Oh honey, he say something like that to you and you have to ask.
Oh ha ha, he straight gay honey."

And everyone laughed and laughed as he tried to explain something.
It was all just too much, and I looked around at the people in the waiting room behind me, but no one was awake or looked up, so I turned back around and yelled, "Hey, hey, someone.
Help."
No one responded so I banged my hand on the desk a few times, it should have had a little bell like a hotel lobby.
I started slipping off the counter.
I couldn't hold myself up, and I don't remember anything else.

\

I woke up in a small hospital bed in a nook on a main hallway cordoned off with a small curtain.
I saw the IV in my arm and, thinking more clearly now, saw money that I didn't have draining from the clear bag into my vein.
Did I really need the hospital, let alone an IV for a head injury?
Wasn't that superfluous?
The whole situation seemed much less serious now that I was out of the fog.
I wondered what time it was.
Hospitals are like casinos, lit the same at every time of day so no one inside can tell what time it is.
It keeps people there longer and whether they're gambling or convalescing it's all money.
I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible; the memories of every time I had been in one of these places, they all look the same, came back to me, and they all had to do with death, illness, or the threat of either.
My head felt better, but that didn't help my mood.
I was in a light blue frock that barely reached my knees.
They had my clothes so they had my details, my drivers' license, debit card.
I was in for it.
A suit with the bus company or cab company could take years, but the debt collectors would be calling me up in half that time.
My credit would be shot, and I wouldn't be able to find an apartment, get a loan, or a mortgage.
I felt hot all over; I shook with rage for a few minutes until I calmed down and decided that all I could do was get it over quickly.
I poked my head out through the curtain; a middle aged doctor saw and walked over.

He came through the curtain, "How are you feeling now?"

"I feel fine, except I fucking hate hospitals."
It just slipped out.

"Yeah me too."
He chuckled.
He irritated me.

"So, where are my clothes, can I go?"

"Soon enough.
I just want to examine you again before you go to make sure the swelling has gone down and that you're in no more danger from the concussion.
It was a pretty bad one, though not so bad that you really need to spend a whole night here.
Probably won't have another one like that unless you toss yourself down some stairs.
How'd it happen?"

"A bus hit the cab I was in.
The ambulance never showed up and the cop just dropped me off at the door."

"That's odd.
Where did it happen?
Wasn't anyone else injured?"
His casualness was getting to me.
He blithely examined my eyes while I explained the details of this outrage.

"It was right around the corner on Market.
I can't believe I was the only one that got hurt.
I can't believe the ambulance never showed up, or that there wasn't anyone at the front desk here.
They were watching Jerry Springer for chrissakes."

"Yeah, they have a TV set in the back.
They're always supposed to have someone at the desk when they watch TV.
I'll talk to someone about it.
Open your mouth and stick out your tongue."

"Well, it was incredibly negligent.
I could have passed out and died in the damn waiting room"

"Oh, certainly not.
You were never in much danger.
You know I've seen a lot worse than you pass through that door; I can assure you.
Now, have you been drinking at all tonight?"

This question was asked in the same offhand tone, but that's what had really been getting to me.
All I heard was the same question in the same ambivalent tone, "What the fuck!
Can't a man go out and get a drink after work without being hounded by everyone he meets.
Isn't drinking legal for adults?
Hell, it's my goddamned livelihood.
Wouldn't you be shit out of luck if we had a single payer health-care system so you couldn't fleece the uninsured blind for a couple of simple procedures?
I'm fucking 28 years old.
I can have a beer and get into a cab, minding my own damn business and go home without everyone implicitly blaming me for causing the accident between the car I wasn't driving and the fucking city bus.
They weren't hurt, must be because they were sober.
It's all the alcohol's fault, and it's my fault for drinking the alcohol.
Christ, I only had two beers and a shot.
I wasn't exactly falling all over the place, not that I couldn't have been and gotten into a car as easy anything else and plowed into Washington fucking square taking out stollers and puppies as I went by as an example of the evils of alcohol.
Might as well prohibit it again if everyone hates it so much and blames it for everything."

At first when I started yelling he looked shocked and offended, but by the end of my tirade he was looking at his clipboard rapidly checking boxes.
He didn't look up, "You were bleeding more than you should have been from a wound that wasn't all that deep.
And now I know it was because of the alcohol which thins your blood and diminishes its clotting abilities."

"Oh.
Well, I mean the bus driver and the cop they both had this tone when they asked.
Never mind."

"Ok, well you seem fine."
He said tersely as he got up and put the clipboard under his arm.
"Leave you insurance details at the front desk.
We couldn't find them in your wallet.
If you don't we'll just bill your home.
Get some aspirin because you'll be having headaches for awhile, maybe a week or so.
Not much to do about that.
And lay off the booze for about a week just in case.
And you should really get a check up because all that nicotine and alcohol won't be good for you much longer."

"Ok."

"Your clothes are next to the bed.
I'll let you get dressed, you can go."

I walked home and went to bed.
