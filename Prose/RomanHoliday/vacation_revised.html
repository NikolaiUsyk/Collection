From above it looks brown almost like a desert, but a darker brown
that lets you know there is no sand but dirt and browned grass and
centuries of civilization.  Hanging like a boot, it protrudes from
the nether side of the &ldquo;Old World,&rdquo; which is what we
Americans are so fond of calling it, as if the continent is a parent
whom we have separated from and bettered.  We may have improved on
their formula for civilization, or we may not have, but we have
decidedly segued from their original influence.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	Rome is perched on a plateau through which a river, which they call
the Tevere, and we call the Tiber, flows in between various hills. 
The streets can be as narrow as sidewalks, and the pedestrians
intersperse much more dangerously with the traffic there than in any
section of any American city.  Because of the large amount of
tourists who are unfamiliar with this traffic system and the inherent
dangers within it, there can be heard more ambulance sirens in one
day in this city than in ten in any American city.  I suppose this
proves that whoever first said, &ldquo;Better safe than sorry,&rdquo;
was not an Italian.   Apart from the streets, one immediately notices
that Rome is less of a city than one big restaurant/museum.  On every
street corner there is a restaurant, sometimes the whole street is a
restaurant, and much of the time there is an adjacent piazza with an
extraordinary piece of original renaissance artwork by Bernini,
Michaelangelo, or one of their students.  There are no gas guzzling
SUVs or Wawa gas stations that take up entire city blocks, miles upon
miles of strip malls, or huge expanses of car dealerships which all
too often dominate the modern American landscape.  Even trucks in
Italy are small, gas stations are simply a pump on the side of a
road, and a strip mall would look rather incongruous next to the
Piazza del Popoli.    America is decidedly different from the &ldquo;Old
World,&rdquo; of Europe.  I suppose its because we have so much extra
land that we don&rsquo;t know what to do with.  We&rsquo;ve
supersized western culture and left its originators in the dust, in
this &ldquo;Old World&rdquo; that is so small and behind the times. 
There is a story to tell here in this antiquated landscape, as there
is in all landscapes large or small, modern or old.  And as I glided
over the rustic Northwestern Italian coast with its dull yellow grass
thinly letting the dull brown dirt seep through on United Air flight
whatever; I could not help but reflect on the circumstances that
brought me here and marvel at the radiance that dozed next to me as
the sun came up.

	Her face needs no external illumination; its beauty is luminescent
enough.  The freckles congregate on the bridge of her nose and then
as if its slope was a playground sliding board, they slide down and
rarify upon her cheeks.  I always thought that this was because her
skin was far too soft and smooth for any of the freckles to avoid
slipping down the slope of her small nose which would more than
occasionally turn red at the end from allergies, colds or irritation.
 Her large green eyes show various degrees of our new brownish
landscape in them.  They draw you in with their large naked
innocence, beckoning you to come forward to take a closer look, where
you discover that they have themselves seen suffering too and have
more depth than innocence.  Her longish medium brown hair is let down
covering her one shoulder as her head rests against the plastic
window pane.  Her eyes are covered and her mouth is slightly ajar, as
it always is when she sleeps.  And as much as I am in awe of the
beauty of a sunrise over the picturesque Italian coast, I am left
breathless by her lithe figure.</p>

	Plenty of people meet their first love in college, but it never
lasts.  You go home for a time, and realize you&rsquo;re from
different worlds.  You formulate irreconcilable differences, and go
through identity crises that you could have sworn you left back in
high school.  All of this happened, none of it happened, and things
fall apart like a loosely woven worn out tablecloth.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We were together and in love a few months ago, and I was never
happier.  Then it stopped and I realized the inherent fragility of
emotion.  I didn&rsquo;t know whether to cry or fight.  And the worst
part is that I have a million reasons, and none at the same time.  We
were two liberal college freshmen the kind with social consciences
borne of a shortage of practicality and an excess of theory.  We
planned a vacation to Rome; I had never left the country.  I had an
insufferable urge to see the Old World that we Americans have
rendered obsolete.  Her mother was renting an apartment there and
teaching Law classes that summer; the opportunity was perfect until
we ended our affair and I was left holding my plane ticket saying,
&ldquo;Well what about our trip?&rdquo;

&ldquo;We&rsquo;re still friends, we can still go.&rdquo;  She
assured me without conviction and with that hint of awkwardness
always apparent in separated couples attempting to forge anything
platonic.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
I meant to reply, &ldquo;But I love you.&rdquo;  The words got to the
tip of my tongue; then they died.</p>

I thought that I might gain some wisdom from the old world for this
matter.  This land had been through everything; it must have some
wisdom to impart to me.  I couldn&rsquo;t predict what would happen
in Rome, because anything could happen.  There were many elements of
our relationship present, and just as many that had deteriorated
completely.  But I was on the plane now, and I knew that I could do
nothing but watch her as she woke up from her sleep.  Her lashes
danced, she yawned, and her svelte body straightened itself to an
upright position on her seat.  She turned to me noticing my attention
was on her and asked with a smile that most banal question reserved
mostly for children in the backseat of a car on their way to family
vacation, &ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Here have some gum so
your ears don&rsquo;t fall off while we&rsquo;re landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She smirked and said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; while taking the gum.
 Her smile was comforting.</p>

	We arrived at the airport and picked up our bags, I had in addition
to my luggage bags also picked up bags under my eyes.  I had not
slept the entire flight which lasted an entire night.  I believe it
was the fact that I cannot sleep upright comfortably, although it
could have been the fact that I did not want to take my eyes off of
her.  We stood outside of the airport and found her mother waiting to
greet us.  We set off on a train into Rome.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	The train did not take long at all and when we got out we were in
the city.  It was dry and very hot;  the streets reflected the heat. 
They were built with black stones which, worn from use, were smooth
and reflective.  We crossed a very busy, convoluted intersection and
walked into the Piazza del Popoli.  I immediately noticed that
everything was old, older than anything I had ever seen, and I knew
it.  I could see the architecture traveling through time, past
Machiavelli to Napoleon to Hitler and Mussolini.  The piazza was a
large circle a hundred yards or more in diameter.  An obelisk rose
out of the middle of it flanked on four sides by fountains where
lions spit water into pools.  Three main avenues began at the
Southern end of the piazza and on that Southern end two magnificent
buildings with Latin inscriptions stand guarding the passageway to
Rome&rsquo;s center with churches.  The name means &ldquo;piazza of
the people&rdquo; and nothing could be more apt.  All around it
people walked or sat and rested from the heat in cafes on the side. 
It was nice to see people outside in the middle of the day enjoying
their city.  The pace of life was slower, easier, more leisurely.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We got dropped off our luggage and decided to explore this foreign
city.  We began walking South down the Via Ripetta, a stone street
like all the streets in Rome, and although it was a main throughway
of the city, it was no wider than a Philadelphian alley-way.  This
road, as most others in the city, is marked by large apartments with
restaurants on the bottom floor.  All the buildings look as if they
were cast in a plaster mold with irregularities in the siding.  They
were beautiful and I knew that most, if not all of them had seen
history dating back past Napoleon, the unification of Italy, a world
war, and the whirlwind changes of twentieth century technology.  Most
stood about seven stories tall with a large atrium inside, and were
furnished, as ours was in the most modern style with solid, bright,
contrasting colors.  We wandered along the street and turned down
alleyways based on whether they were shaded or not.  Although it was
a dry heat, it was oppressive.  We may as well have been carrying the
sun on our backs.  The series of shaded streets turned this way and
that, until our collective sense of direction failed and we stumbled
upon the Pantheon.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	The Pantheon is one of the most impressive sights I&rsquo;ve ever
seen.  It rises unannounced in the middle of apartment buildings and
restaurants, a massive, wide six-story, solid stone, dark grey
edifice cracked and worn from the centuries and the wars and the
progress that surrounds it.  A small piazza sits in front of it with
five restaurants on the perimeter and a small fountain in the center.
 The magnitude of the Pantheon rises up from its surrounding
alleyways and the crowds of people sitting on its steps or dining in
the restaurants, in the shadow of a structure that has stood an
incredible test of time, not only time but urban time.  Urban time is
crowded and always changing dynamically, it wants to knock down the
old to make room for the new, but this has survived.  I wondered what
it was like when it was new and the ancient Romans&hellip;</p>

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	Marcus and Claudio met outside the Pantheon quite unexpectedly. 
They had arrived from different directions; Claudio was walking North
from his city abode that stood in between the Circus Maximus and the
Coliseum, and Marcus was walking South from his villa North of Rome. 
They had grown up together on the city&rsquo;s patrician streets and
had now raised their positions in society beyond what they were born
into.  Claudio became a master rhetorician and orator, and Marcus had
risen to the rank of general in the army.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ho, Claudio.  It&rsquo;s been ages since I saw you last.  How
have you been?&rdquo;  Marcus began on seeing Claudio first.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ah, Marcus, my friend it is good to see you.  I&rsquo;ve been
well, what brings you here to the great temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying my respects to Mars, who has given our
armies the strength to push back the barbarian hoards congregating in
the North.  They know nothing of valor or bravery.  They also know
nothing of military science, and we have pushed them back through
their cowardice and ignorance.  They come at us head over foot,
tumbling like logs and we slaughter them at our feet!&rdquo;  Marcus
completed this little speech with an outburst of pride and hatred for
the enemy, Claudio was slightly taken aback.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Well, the barbarians know nothing of our ways, and I shall be
sure to report to the senate what you have told me concerning the
state of our affairs in the North.&rdquo;  Claudio said respectfully.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ah, Claudio, let it be so.  For if we conquer these tribes at
once they shall be ours forever, but if we lose our tenacity they may
have time to regroup and gain strength.  We are entering a new age
and in this time of modernity we must prepare for Rome&rsquo;s
future.  But even this concerns me little.    Tell me, Claudio, why
you have come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;My wife has died.&rdquo;  Claudio said and paused, &ldquo;I
am giving offerings to Pluto and Venus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;My friend, why did you say that you were well?&rdquo;  Marcus
exclaimed shocked.    &ldquo;And why are you giving an offering to
Venus for the death of your wife?&rdquo; asked Marcus concerned and
confused.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I am offering to Venus because I am grateful for the love
that I was given even if it is gone.  And upon seeing you, my old
friend, I am well.  For when friendship lasts grief may not.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I was jostled from my vision by a finger poking me in the ribs.  She
stood next to me smiling, but attempting to pretend as if she hadn&rsquo;t
done anything, looking straight ahead at the giant metal doors of the
Pantheon.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;You think you can just poke me anytime you&rsquo;d like,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;  I asked feigning anger.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She smiled and nodded emphatically.  I tried to poke her in the
stomach but she blocked me.  I tried to poke her in the shoulder with
the same hand but she blocked that and I quickly used my other hand
to poke her quickly in the stomach under the ribs.  I smiled
victoriously and said, &ldquo;Ha, there you see I win.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She laughed and straightened herself.  Smiling she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not supposed to win.&rdquo;  She attacked with a barrage of index
fingers pointed at my chest.  I grabbed her hands and said, &ldquo;See
you can&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;  I pulled both hands out to my sides
which brought her body closer and closer to mine.  I wanted to let
her poke me as much as she&rsquo;d like and just hold her close, the
way I used to do.  I let my guard down and her hand escaped, jabbing
me right below the ribs.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; she exclaimed mockingly, &ldquo;there you see I
win.  I always win; you should have learned that by now.&rdquo;  I
doubled over in feigned pain from the mock-violent jab in the ribs.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I straightened myself up and we began walking away from the
Pantheon.  Not knowing where we were or in what direction we were
traveling.  She asked me, &ldquo;What were you thinking about back
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh, I dunno, I was lost in thought.  I was imagining how it
must have been when the Pantheon was just built.  All things are new
once right?  Even when they&rsquo;re ancient now.  Sometimes I like
to imagine something as young when it&rsquo;s old or vice versa.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always had such an active imagination.  You just
walk around in a daze sometimes.  I wonder if you imagine more things
than are really there sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I was about to protest until she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh the Piazza
Navona, that&rsquo;s where the fountain of the four rivers is.  It&rsquo;s
on my list of things to see, let&rsquo;s go there.&rdquo;  She said
excitedly, pointing at the signpost with arrows.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Sure let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;  We began walking in its
direction.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;The fountain was made by Bernini in the eighteenth century. 
It&rsquo;s a great piece of renaissance sculpture.&rdquo;  She added.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ah, terrific, well here you go; you get to reap the benefits
of all those hellish art history classes here don&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh, they weren&rsquo;t so bad except for the hundreds of note
cards I had to memorize.  It&rsquo;s a very interesting subject; it&rsquo;s
just that it can&rsquo;t be learnt any other way.  If only they had a
way to assimilate all the knowledge into your brain instantly, that&rsquo;d
be cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yeah, and then they&rsquo;d come up with a pill to make your
shit smell like roses fresh from the garden.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Hey, it could happen.  When they make me unquestioned ruler
of the universe it will.&rdquo;  She added with a self-satisfied
smile.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yes of course my liege.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;ll happen.&rdquo;  She said laughing.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Of course it will.&rdquo;  I said.  Then I stopped short and
made a deep bow.  She laughed, and grabbed me by the elbow pulling me
up and next to her.  She held on to my elbow more than she needed to,
and I smiled, a large smile from ear to ear.  Her warm, soft hand was
just as I remembered it.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She let go when we arrived in the Piazza Navona.  It is a long
elliptical piazza, with a large magnificent fountain in the middle
and two smaller fountains on either side.  It is surrounded totally
by caf&eacute;&rsquo;s, gelaterias, restaurants, and churches. 
People are everywhere, sitting by the fountains, selling wares in
little kiosks strewn around the piazza, in caf&eacute;&rsquo;s, and
restaurants everywhere there is activity, but it isn&rsquo;t rushed
or hurried.  There are no businessmen in suits barreling through the
crowd which dominate the streets back home.  There are no cars, only
people everywhere sitting around enjoying the day.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We approached the main fountain through the crowd.  There were four
sculptures of men, most likely Roman gods I thought, at each corner
of the magnificent obelisk in the middle.  Each of them had a
fountain and a pool of water under them.  I imagined the people who
made this art standing around in their full renaissance regalia, and
I wondered how they could have worn such things it in such oppressive
heat.  This piazza and fountain is so old, but so much newer than the
Pantheon.  Our new world will one day be old, but still newer than
this.  But then I thought: what&rsquo;s the difference, when it&rsquo;s
old it&rsquo;s old.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I looked at the fountain and she explained it to me mimicking an art
history professor at first, but then receding into girlish
excitement, &ldquo;Each of the four men represents a major river.  I
know one is the Danube, and one is the Nile, but I forget the other
two.  You see how lifelike they are?  It&rsquo;s because Bernini was
one of the greatest sculptors of all time; he was incredible.  I
mean, don&rsquo;t the features just grab you and look real, like
there&rsquo;s blood underneath the marble.&rdquo;  She paused, I
nodded.  &ldquo;Anyway, if you look at the guy over on this side.&rdquo;
 She paused and pointed.  &ldquo;This one right here.  Do you see how
he&rsquo;s looking the other way in disgust, holding his hand up to
block his view or something?&rdquo;  I nodded.  I hadn&rsquo;t
noticed it, but the statue was turning away as if in disgust, his
face looked like he was about to throw up, and he was holding out his
hand as if to say, &ldquo;Ughhhhh, how horrible.&rdquo;  She
continued, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing that because of that church in
front of him, right here.&rdquo;  She paused, pointed, and I looked. 
&ldquo;Do you see how that church has a concave front?&rdquo;  I
nodded and said, &ldquo;Yeah, so?&rdquo;  She continued, &ldquo;So, a
church done with a front like that was highly unorthodox at this
time, and was a major no-no in Bernini&rsquo;s school especially. 
The man who designed this church was a student of Bernini&rsquo;s and
was one of his favorites, until he built that church, which Bernini
thought was horrible, and an affront to God.  He was highly offended
and sculpted this guy on the fountain here to show what he thought of
the church and his ex-student.  That&rsquo;s why he is turned away as
if he is disgusted by the church to the point of physical sickness.&rdquo;</p>

	&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s really interesting.  It&rsquo;s kind of
like an art vendetta or something.  Man you art students know
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yes, yes we do,&rdquo; she said and smiled.  &ldquo;Just look
at the fountains and the people and the rock, it&rsquo;s so
beautiful, I can&rsquo;t understand how anyone&hellip;</p>

	The old master strode into the piazza with the aid of a cane.  Two
students flanked him as he walked and shared his knowledge.  He may
have been in his mid-seventies.  His life of meticulous chiseling,
painting, attention to detail, and artistic development has left his
myopic eyes drooping, and his once steady and solid back hunched. 
His skin is withered and his legs quake under the weight of his frail
body, but his mind is sharp.  It is all he has left.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;This fountain is possibly my best work.&rdquo;  He commented
to his two disciples.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;It is certainly magnificent, teacher, but what about your
work at the Vatican, or our great churches.  Surely they give more
glory to God, so that you&rsquo;re great art reflects his greatness.&rdquo;
 A pupil chimed in.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;however, I have
always thought of what Our Savior had said, &lsquo;Give to God what
is God&rsquo;s, and give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s.&rsquo;  He
is talking to the people.  I have always believed that he meant what
he left unsaid, which is that you must give the most to the people
because most things reside between God and Caesar.  There is
certainly art that should be given to the people.  Here is the best
work that I have given to the public.  It&rsquo;s good that I have
done something like this for Rome.  I may do art for God in his
churches and I may do art for the ruling families, but this is art
for the people, to be enjoyed by one and all.  In doing this I have
honored Christ&rsquo;s message.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;This is certainly true, teacher.&rdquo; The other pupil
responded with a reproachful look at his classmate.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;When I created this fountain, I did it out of a sense of
righteousness, and not for the people, to whom I owe so much.  I have
always been bothered by this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Certainly, teacher, we understand the meaning of the
fountain, and we believe your motives to be most righteous.  Such an
affront to God and in the architecture of his very church should not
go unreproached.  Your act is noble and shall serve a reminder to
anyone who would go about blaspheming in the way that this man has
done.  It&rsquo;s an abomination!&rdquo;  The pupil became animated
and indignant at the end of his speech until the master lifted a hand
from his cane to silence him.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No my student, I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;How could you be wrong, teacher, the church is an
abomination?&rdquo;  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;The man who built this church that I so insulted was once a
student of mine, but he came under influences other than me, from
Firenze, Bologna, Napoli, and his own imagination.  He threw all that
I had taught him back at me in this church, and I was angry.  But one
should not act out of anger; much less create art out of it.  And I
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;But he was wrong to have foregone your teaching for the
teachings of inferiors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No, my student, he created a new school, and I was angry at
him for abandoning mine.  He will one day have students to whom he
will tell how his old teacher, shunned his work and insulted him in
his art, and he will be correct in his reproach.  The church is
beautiful, as all art is in all its schools.  We improved upon the
ancient schools and new schools shall improve upon us.  Art is
created, cycles repeat, and the world changes.  Look at the Pantheon;
look at the Coliseum; they&rsquo;re in another style yet they are
ancient and grand.  This will too be ancient and grand one day, and
others will have no idea of the style, just as we have no idea of the
Ancient&rsquo;s style.  I have learned this in my old age.  One day
my school shall be ancient and all that will be left of it will be my
sculptures and paintings, including this fountain.  I only wish that
he would turn his head and smile at the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
&ldquo;Teacher, your talk disturbs me.  Your school shall live on as
long as there is art.  People will recognize your greatness and
create art in accordance with your school until the Savior comes
again.&rdquo;  The pupil persisted.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No, my student, you will one day realize that he who fights
against the future will find himself as I find myself, a crippled old
man.&rdquo;

	I forgot how she trailed off, but I remember how she regained my
attention.  She put her head on my shoulder the way she used to;
where her long neck contours to my bony shoulder, and her head rests
on the soft sinewy tendons and muscles of my lower neck.  It came
without warning, roused me from my daydream, and reduced me to a
puddle.  My knees went limp, my head spun, and my mind wandered in
its spinning haze to the way it was when we were together, and I did
not feel compelled to mask my heart.  I put my hand around her waist,
that beautiful thin waist, where my hand fit like a tailored glove,
and I was in ecstasy.  That moment in time for me was the epitome of
bittersweet, so much that I could not endure its torturous rapture
for more than a moment.  So I broke it.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I straightened myself bringing my shoulder up which pushed her head
jerkingly back into its upright position.  &ldquo;I think the church
is beautiful, I understand how it was a break from orthodoxy, but I
can&rsquo;t imagine that an artistic master would fail to recognize
the aesthetic where it lies.&rdquo;  I really just rambled that out,
because I needed to say something to give myself space and time to
recover.  She saw right through it, she always knew when I was being
disingenuous. 
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	So she took a step away from me and gave me the space I needed, to
recover my heart&rsquo;s lost beats.  &ldquo;He considered it an
affront to God.  I suppose he thought that because no Christian
architecture had ever had such a design and possibly pagan ones had. 
I&rsquo;m not sure, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d think.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s reasonable, I suppose that if he
considered the architecture to be an attempt to bring a pagan
influence upon sacred Christianity, which could make sense.  Either
way the fountain is magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;It certainly is, but this piazza isn&rsquo;t too far away
from where we&rsquo;re staying, at least I think it isn&rsquo;t.  I
really don&rsquo;t know where we are.  We&rsquo;ll probably be here a
lot, let&rsquo;s go walk some more.&rdquo;  So we made our way out of
the piazza, not knowing exactly where we were, but knowing that we
were most likely no great distance from the apartment.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Your hair is getting long again.&rdquo; she commented
matter-of-factly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I suppose it is, it&rsquo;s apt to do such things as grow.&rdquo;
 I paused, &ldquo;I know you always liked it short, but I&rsquo;m too
lazy for the barber.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;And too poor, way to get a job this summer.&rdquo;  She cut
in quickly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I tried to get one, I really did.  Plus they have room for me

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ughhhhh, what a horrible job.  You shouldn&rsquo;t do it,

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I guess, but it&rsquo;s better than nothing.  This way I&rsquo;ll
be able to get my hair cut this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;  She asked with surprising expectancy.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Well you should, it looks better on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so.  I&rsquo;ve never gotten your thing

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;It feels cooler when it&rsquo;s short.  Plus it looks clean

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re telling me that you

your bedroom floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She giggled.  &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s an order to that mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s an order to the mess on my head.&rdquo;  I
concluded triumphantly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Psssht.&rdquo;  She turned her head mock-indignantly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you with your hair buzzed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh, I plan on it, and I may let you see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d be honored if I could milady.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I laughed.  We had crossed a large, very busy street and found
ourselves on a bridge over the river Tiber.  It wasn&rsquo;t a wide
river and had long since been kidnapped from its Mother Nature and
come under the dominance of our human race.  The banks were
sidewalks, on which very few people walked and after the unused
sidewalks a levee stood some thirty foot high leading onto the very
busy road or the bridge which stood some forty to fifty feet above
the deep green water at its apex.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Fancy a dip?&rdquo;  I asked her</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;You first.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Wanna go down and sit there anyway, its gotta be cooler than
up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo;  She replied and we walked down the steps.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	It was cooler down there.  The water, obviously polluted from
centuries of advanced civilization and human development, was crusted
in some parts with algae because the river was very slow moving, as
if it had been mellowed by the monotonous rise and fall of the
empires it has seen.  Mostly though, the river just looked very
polluted, and old.  That is, if a river can look old.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Hey, did you see that?&rdquo;  She asked me suddenly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;A fish just jumped out of the water, it was huge in the
middle of the river.&rdquo;  We paused watching, &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s
another one.&rdquo;  She exclaimed after a few seconds.  I saw that
one.  It looked like a large pikefish, if there are pikefish in
Italy, which I doubt.  It was about a shoulders breadth long.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that the pollution could have mutated a
goldfish into that.&rdquo;  I said.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She laughed at my corny joke, she always did that.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She turned around toward the river and looked at it after she said
that.  I was standing about two paces behind her.  So I suddenly ran
up from behind and grabbed her by the waist as if to throw her in the
water; I even lifted her off the ground.  She shrieked.  I set her
back down on dry land.  I turned around laughing raucously.  She was
infuriated and came at me with two flailing open palms.  She&rsquo;s
no Mike Tyson; I wasn&rsquo;t worried for my health.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you scare me like that.&rdquo;  She chided me and
began to laugh herself.  I grabbed her hands and immobilized them not
allowing her to hit me anymore.  She never liked feeling weaker than
anyone else and began fighting me relentlessly for the use of her
hands.  I gave them up when I tired from the game, and she hit me
again after I had given her hands back to her.  I laughed.  She
turned away and walked back toward the river with her back to me with
another air of mock-indignation.  She took three steps and then
faltered on the fourth, as if unsure of where to put her foot.  She
put it down and turned to me, but her look had a wholly different
quality than what I had expected.  It was not indignant in the least,
nor malicious, nor teasing, nor playful.  I had only seen a look one
other time in my life and she was the one who gave it to me then too&hellip;</p>

	An American dorm room, 12&rsquo; x 12&rsquo; in mid-February.  The
white cinder block walls do little to keep out the winter chill; a
bed with a cover and a tangle of uncovered arms and legs and two
bodies held close underneath it.  This is beautiful.  We look each
other in the eyes and kiss softly, closed-mouth, on the lips.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	The winter wind blew outside the inadequately insulated room, and we
heard its high-pitched whine.  	</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I squeezed her against me, and she squeezed me tight too.  I loosed
my arms but she kept hers taut for a few extra seconds.  She leant
back, my arms cradling her, and gave me a funny look of completely
helpless confusion, mixed with a little irritation.	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sorry.  I love you, but this isn&rsquo;t right, and I don&rsquo;t
know why.&rdquo;  She said with a choke.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve been feeling like that lately, but we&rsquo;ll
get through it together; I mean, I know something hasn&rsquo;t been
quite right for a little while, but we&rsquo;ve only been together a
couple of months, and we&rsquo;ll get through it.&rdquo;  I said this
quickly with a smile to placate her doubts with my blind optimism but
towards the end I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t working this time.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;This hasn&rsquo;t been working, and I think I need time to
sort things out.  I rushed into this, but I don&rsquo;t know how to
have a serious relationship.  I don&rsquo;t know what I want, and I
don&rsquo;t know how to love you the way you love me, and I need to
find things out about myself, because I don&rsquo;t know why this
doesn&rsquo;t work.&rdquo;  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;What do you mean this doesn&rsquo;t work.  I love you, you
love me, what more could there be to it.&rdquo;  I put in quickly, I
was almost panicking, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how this isn&rsquo;t
right, but I&rsquo;ll do anything to make it right, I&rsquo;ll cross
the Pacific in a canoe, I&rsquo;ll walk on hot coals, I&rsquo;ll swim
in the East River, I&rsquo;ll go on a mythical quest.&rdquo;  All the
time I was saying this, and I was saying it frantically, she was
shaking her head sorrowfully.  And that&rsquo;s when I saw the look,
it was something like resignation and sorrow at what should be and
what is.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lasso the moon; I&rsquo;ll bring it down
just for you.&rdquo;  I added slowly with a hopeless smile.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;You know better than all this.&rdquo;  She deadpanned while
her eyes were welling up.</p>

	She laughed pathetically, and smiled at me.  &ldquo;I wish I could

can&rsquo;t, at least not right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">

	&ldquo;Well I do, but I just don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;  She paused,

	She smiled weakly, &ldquo;Yeah Right, you&rsquo;ll snap out of that
quickly.  You&rsquo;ll meet another girl, they all do.  You&rsquo;ll
be happy with her.&rdquo;</p>

becoming adults is about figuring out.&rdquo;</p>

	I found myself sitting next to her on the bank of the river.  Its
polluted green water slowly, lazily flowing out to the sea like a
slug across a leaf.  We just sat and watched the old river flow like
a place that has seen the world change from empire to empire, or a
veteran of war with shrapnel in his ankle or a lonely elderly widower
mourning the loss of his only companion. She broke the silence when
she asked, &ldquo;Who was it that said, &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t step
into the same river twice.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yeah, all that overly rational bullshit comes from the

	She sounded surprised, &ldquo;What, you don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s
true?&rdquo;  She asked.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;  I paused and looked toward
the retreating sun.  &ldquo;No, if you wait long enough even rivers
repeat themselves.&rdquo;</p>
