<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	From above it looks brown,
like a desert, but a darker brown that lets you know there is no
sand, but dirt and browned grass and centuries of civilization. 
Hanging like a boot, it protrudes from the nether side of the &ldquo;Old
World,&rdquo; which is what we Americans are so fond of calling it,
as if the continent is a parent whom we have separated from and
bettered.  We may have improved on their formula for civilization, or
we may not have, but we have decidedly segued from their original
influence.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Rome is perched on a plateau
through which a river, which they call the Tevere, and we call the
Tiber, flows in between various hills.  The streets can be as narrow
as sidewalks, and the pedestrians intersperse much more dangerously
with the traffic there than in any section of any American city. 
Because of the large amount of tourists who are unfamiliar with this
traffic system, and the inherent dangers within it, there can be
heard more ambulance sirens in one day in this city than in ten in
any American city.  I suppose this proves that whoever first said,
&ldquo;Better safe than sorry,&rdquo; was not an Italian.   Apart
from the streets, one immediately notices that Rome is less of a city
than one big restaurant/museum.  On every street corner there is a
restaurant, sometimes the whole street is a restaurant, and much of
the time there is an adjacent piazza with an extraordinary piece of
original renaissance artwork, by Bernini, or Michaelangelo, or one of
their students.  There are no gas guzzling SUVs or Wawa gas stations
that take up entire city blocks, or miles upon miles of strip malls
which dominate the modern American landscape.  Even trucks in Italy
are small, gas stations are simply a pump on the side of a road, and
a strip mall would look somewhat incongruous next to the Piazza del
Popoli.    So America is different from the &ldquo;Old World,&rdquo;
of Europe, I suppose its because we have so much extra land that we
don&rsquo;t know what to do with.  We&rsquo;ve supersized western
culture and left its originators in the dust, in this &ldquo;Old
World&rdquo; that is so small and so behind the times.  But in this
landscape there is a story to tell, as there is in all landscapes. 
And as I glided over the rustic Northwestern Italian coast with its
dull yellow grass thinly letting the dull brown dirt seep through on
United Air flight whatever, I could not help but marvel at the
radiance that dozed next to me as the sun came up. </font>

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Her face needs no external
illumination, its beauty is luminescent enough.  The freckles
congregate on the bridge of her nose and then as if its slope was a
playground sliding board, they slide down and rarify upon her cheeks.
 I always thought that this was because her skin was far too soft and
smooth for any of the freckles to avoid slipping down the slope of
her small, well-shaped nose which would more than occasionally turn
red at the end from allergies or colds or irritation.  Her large
green eyes show various degrees of our new brownish landscape in
them.  They draw you in with their large naked innocence, beckoning
you to come forward to take a closer look, where you discover that
they have themselves seen suffering too and have more depth than
innocence.  Her longish medium brown hair is let down covering her
one shoulder as her small head rests against the plastic window pane.
 Her eyes are covered and her mouth is slightly ajar, as it always is
when she sleeps.  And as much as I am in awe of the beauty of a
sunrise over the picturesque Italian coast, I am left breathless by
her lithe figure.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She woke up as we neared
Rome&rsquo;s Fumincino airport as we began our descent.  Her lashes
danced, she yawned, and her svelte body straightened itself to an
upright position on her seat.  She turned to me noticing my attention
was on her and asked that most banal question reserved mostly for
children in the backseat of a car on their way to family vacation,
&ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;  She smiled.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; I
answered, &ldquo;Here have some gum so your ears don&rsquo;t fall off
while we&rsquo;re landing.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She smirked and said, &ldquo;Thank
you.&rdquo; while taking the gum.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We arrived at the airport and
picked up our bags, I had in addition to my luggage bags also picked
up bags under my eyes, I had not slept the entire flight which
encompassed an entire night.  I believe it was the fact that I cannot
sleep upright comfortably; although it could have been the fact that
I did not want to take my eyes off of her.  We stood outside of the
airport and found her mother waiting to greet us.  We set off on a
train into Rome.  The train took us to the outskirts of Rome, from
there we took a few different subway trains and arrived at the
station Flaminio.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We disembarked and walked
with our luggage out of the station and onto the street.  It was dry
and very hot, the streets reflected the heat as they were built with
black stones, which, worn from use, were smooth and reflective.  We
crossed a very busy convoluted intersection and walked into the
Piazza del Popoli.  This piazza is a large circle a hundred yards or
more in diameter.  An obelisk rises out of the middle of it flanked
on four sides by fountains where lions spit water into pools.  Three
main avenues begin at the Southern end of the piazza and on that
Southern end two magnificent buildings with Latin inscriptions stand,
guarding as it were, the passageway to Rome&rsquo;s center.  I
suppose they were churches, although I never found out for sure. 
Guarding the Northern end of the piazza were giant columns with Latin
inscriptions on headstones on top of them.  The center of the piazza
was lower than the rest of it, which gave it a slight amphitheater
like appearance.  It was the piazza of the people, and the people
enjoyed it, all around it people walked or sat, or rested from the
heat in cafes on the side.  It was nice to see people outside in the
middle of the day enjoying their city.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We came to the apartment and
rested a bit, but decided to investigate the city before dinnertime. 
Her mother had gone to teach a class and we were left alone in an
eternal city, what could we do but explore, although I was almost
delirious from having not slept two hours in the past 30.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We began walking South down
the Via Ripetta, a stone street like all the streets in Rome, and
although it was a main throughway of the city, it was no wider than a
Philadelphian side street.  This road, as most others in the city, is
marked by large apartments with restaurants on the bottom floor.  All
the buildings look as if they were cast in a plaster mold with
irregularities in the siding.  They were beautiful and I knew that
most, if not all of them had seen history dating back past Napoleon,
the unification of Italy, a world war, and the whirlwind changes of
twentieth century technology.  Most stood about seven stories tall
with a large atrium inside, and were furnished, as ours was in the
most modern style with solid, bright, contrasting colors.  The
differences between the outside and the inside struck me as an
amusing contrast of past and present.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The via Ripetta is a
beautiful street, but so are almost all Roman streets.  We walked
along the sliver of sidewalk sometimes interrupted by cafes.  Sparse
traffic from very compact cars rumbled by on the old street made of
black inlaid stones.  And tiny motor scooters whizzed by carelessly,
in no hurry, as if there was all the time in the world.  And maybe
there is, but where I&rsquo;m from there isn&rsquo;t.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We wandered along the street
and turned down alleyways based on whether they were shady or not. 
Although it was a dry heat it was oppressive.  We may as well have
been carrying the sun on our backs.  The series of shaded streets
turned from alleyway to alleyway, until our collective sense of
direction failed and we stumbled upon the Pantheon.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	The Pantheon is one of the
most impressive sights I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  It rises unannounced in
the middle of apartment buildings and restaurants, a six story solid
stone dark grey edifice cracked and worn from the centuries and the
wars and the progress that surrounds it.  A small piazza sits in
front of it with five restaurants on the perimeter and a small
fountain in the center, such is the outlay of most piazzas.  The
magnificence of the Pantheon rises up from its surrounding alleyways
and the crowds of people sitting on its steps or dining in the
restaurants, in the shadow of a structure that has stood the test of
time, not only time, but urban time.  Urban time is crowded and
changing dynamically, it wants to knock down the old to make room for
the new, but this survives.  I wondered what it was like when the
ancient Romans</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	Marcus and Claudio met
outside the Pantheon quite unexpectedly.  They had arrived from
different directions,  Claudio was walking North from his city abode
that stood in between the Circus Maximus and the Coliseum, and Marcus
was walking South from his villa North of Rome.  They had grown up
together on the city&rsquo;s patrician streets , and were now even
more well off than they had been growing up.  Claudio becoming a
master rhetorician and orator, and Marcus rising to the rank of
general in the army.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Ho, Claudio.  How have
you been?&rdquo;  Marcus began on seeing Claudio first.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Ah, Marcus, my friend
it is good to see you.  I&rsquo;ve been well, what brings you here to
the great temple.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying my
respects to Mars, who has given our armies the strength to push back
the barbarian hoards attempting to invade from the North.  They know
nothing of valor or bravery.  They also know nothing of military
science, and we have pushed them back both through their cowardice
and ignorance.  They come at us head over foot, tumbling like logs
and we slaughter them at our feet!&rdquo;  Marcus completed this
little speech with an outburst of pride and hatred for the enemy that
Claudio was taken aback.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Well, the barbarians
know nothing of our ways, and I shall be sure to report to the senate
what you have told me concerning the state of our affairs in the
North.&rdquo;  Claudio said respectfully.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Ah, Claudio, let it be
so.  For if we conquer these tribes at once they shall be ours
forever, but if we lose our tenacity, they may have time to regroup
and gain allies.  But even this concerns me little.  Tell me,
Claudio, why you have come here?&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;My wife has died.&rdquo;
 Claudio said and paused, &ldquo;I am giving offerings to Pluto and
Venus.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;My friend, why did you
say that you were well?  And why are you giving an offering to Venus
for the death of your wife?&rdquo; asked Marcus concerned and
confused.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;I am offering to Venus
because I am grateful for the love that I was given even if it is
gone.  And upon seeing you, my old friend, I am well.&rdquo;</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	I was jostled from my vision
by a finger poking me in the ribs.  She stood next to me smiling, but
attempting to pretend as if nothing had happened looking straight
ahead at the giant metal doors of the Pantheon.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;You think you can just
poke me anytime you&rsquo;d like, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;  I asked
feigning anger.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She smiled and nodded
emphatically.  I tried to poke her in the stomach but she blocked me.
 I tried to poke her in the shoulder with the same hand but she
blocked that and I quickly used my other hand to poke her quickly in
the stomach under the ribs.  I smiled victoriously and said, &ldquo;Ha,
there you see I win.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She laughed and straightened
herself.  Smiling she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not supposed to win.&rdquo;
 She attacked with a barrage of index fingers pointed at my chest.  I
grabbed her hands and said, &ldquo;See you can&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;  I
pulled both hands out to my sides which brought her beautiful body
closer and closer to mine.  I wanted to let her poke me as much as
she&rsquo;d like and just hold her close, the way I used to do.  I
let my guard down and her hand escaped, jabbing me right below the
ribs.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; she
exclaimed mockingly, &ldquo;there you see I win.  I always win, you
should have learned that by now.&rdquo;  I doubled over in feigned
pain from the mock-violent jab in the ribs.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Of course you win, you
just wait until I&rsquo;m too tired of playing your games and then
you sweep in to collect your victory, oh queen of queens.&rdquo;  I
said sarcastically. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go explore some more.&rdquo;</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We wandered out of the
Pantheon&rsquo;s area, not knowing where we were going.  Until we saw
a sign pointing the way to the Piazza Navona, among other landmarks.</font></p>

 I said.  Then I stopped short and made a deep bow.  She laughed, and
grabbed me by the elbow pulling me up and next to her.  She held on
to my elbow more than she needed to, and I smiled, a large smile from
ear to ear.  Her warm, soft hand was just as I remembered it,
perfect.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She let go when we arrived in
the Piazza Navona.  It is a long elliptical piazza, with a large
magnificent fountain in the middle and two smaller fountains on
either side.  It is surrounded totally by caf&eacute;&rsquo;s,
gelaterias, restaurants, and churches.  People are everywhere,
sitting by the fountains, selling wares in little kiosks strewn
around the piazza, in caf&eacute;&rsquo;s, and restaurants everywhere
there is activity, but it is leisurely.  There are no cars just
people everywhere, hanging out and enjoying themselves.</font></p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	We approached the main
fountain through the crowd.  There were four sculptures of men, most
likely Roman gods I thought, at each corner of the magnificent
obelisk in the middle.  Each of them had a fountain under them and a
pool of water under them.  </font>
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%">
<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She explained it to me, &ldquo;Each
of the four men represent a major river, I know one is the Danube,
and one is the Nile, but I forget the other two.  You see how
lifelike they are.  Its because Bernini was one of the greatest
sculptors of all time, he was incredible.  I mean, don&rsquo;t the
features just grab you and look real, like there&rsquo;s blood
underneath the marble.&rdquo;  She paused, I nodded.  &ldquo;Anyway,
if you look at the guy over on this side.&rdquo;  She paused and
pointed.  &ldquo;This one right here.  Do you see how he&rsquo;s
looking the other way in disgust, holding his hand up to block his
view or something.&rdquo;  I nodded.  I hadn&rsquo;t noticed it, but
the statue was turning away as if in disgust, his face looked like he
was about to throw up, and he was holding out his hand as if to say,
&ldquo;Ughhhhh, how horrible.&rdquo;  She continued, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
doing that because of that church in front of him, right here.&rdquo;
 She paused, pointed, and I looked.  &ldquo;Do you see how that
church has a concave front?&rdquo;  I nodded and said, &ldquo;Yeah,
so?&rdquo;  She continued, &ldquo;So, a church done with a front like
that was highly unorthodox at this time, and was a major no-no in
Bernini&rsquo;s school especially.  The man who designed this church
was a student of Bernini&rsquo;s and was one of his favorites, until
he built that church, which Bernini thought was horrible, and an
affront to God.  He was highly offended and sculpted this guy on the
fountain here to show what he thought of the church and his
ex-student.  That&rsquo;s why he is turned away as if he is disgusted
by the church to the point of physical sickness.&rdquo;</font></p>

bony shoulder, and her head rests on the soft sinewy tendons and
muscles of my lower neck.  It came without warning, roused me from my
daydream, and reduced me to a puddle.  My knees went limp, my head
spun, and my mind wandered in its spinning haze to the way it was
when we were together, and I did not feel compelled to mask my heart.
 I put my hand around her waist, that beautiful thin waist, where my
hand fit, like a tailored glove, and I was in ecstasy.  The epitome
of bittersweet, was that moment in time, so much that I could not
endure its torturous rapture for more than a moment,.  So I broke it.</font></p>

large, very busy street and found ourselves on a bridge over the
river Tiber.  It wasn&rsquo;t a wide river, and had long since been
kidnapped from its mother nature and come under the dominance of our
human race.  The banks were sidewalks, on which very few people
walked, and after the unused sidewalks a levee stood some thirty foot
high leading onto the very busy road or the bridge which stood some
forty to fifty feet above the deep green water at its apex.</font></p>

The water, obviously polluted from centuries of advanced
civilization, and human development was crusted in some parts with
algae because the river was very slow moving, as if it had been
mellowed by the monotonous rise and fall of the empires it has seen.

paused watching, &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s another one.&rdquo;  She
exclaimed after a few seconds.  I saw that one.  It looked like a
large pikefish, if there are pikefish in Italy, which I doubt.  It
was about a shoulders breadth long.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	She turned around toward the
river and looked at it after she said that.  I was standing about two
paces behind her.  So I suddenly ran up from behind and grabbed her
by the arms as if to throw her in the water, I even lifted her off
the ground.  She shrieked.  But I set her back down on dry land.  I
turned around laughing raucously.  She was inflamed and came at me
with both fingers flicking at my ears.  For some reason she had
always associated ear flicking with some kind of disgrace or
punishment.  The memory of this only made me laugh harder.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you scare
me like that.&rdquo;  She chided me and began to laugh herself.  I
grabbed her hands and immobilized them not allowing her to flick me
anymore.  She never liked feeling weaker than anyone else, and began
fighting me relentlessly for the use of her hands.  I gave them up
when I tired from the game, and she flicked me again, after I had
given her hands back to her.  I laughed.  She turned away and walked
back toward the river with her back to me with another air of
mock-indignation.  She took three steps and then faltered on the
fourth, as if unsure of where to put her foot.  She put it down and
turned to me, but her look had a wholly different quality than what I
had expected.  It was not indignant in the least, nor malicious, nor
teasing, nor playful.  I had only seen a look one other time in my
life and she was the one who gave it to me then too.</font></p>
