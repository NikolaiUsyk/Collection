	From above it looks brown, like a desert, but a darker brown that
lets you know there is no sand, but dirt and browned grass and
centuries of civilization.  Hanging like a boot, it protrudes from
the nether side of the &ldquo;Old World,&rdquo; which is what we
Americans are so fond of calling it, as if the continent is a parent
whom we have separated from and bettered.  We may have improved on
their formula for civilization, or we may not have, but we have
decidedly segued from their original influence.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	Rome is perched on a plateau through which a river, which they call
the Tevere, and we call the Tiber, flows in between various hills. 
The streets can be as narrow as sidewalks, and the pedestrians
intersperse much more dangerously with the traffic there than in any
section of any American city.  Because of the large amount of
tourists who are unfamiliar with this traffic system, and the
inherent dangers within it, there can be heard more ambulance sirens
in one day in this city than in ten in any American city.  I suppose
this proves that whoever first said, &ldquo;Better safe than sorry,&rdquo;
was not an Italian.   Apart from the streets, one immediately notices
that Rome is less of a city than one big restaurant/museum.  On every
street corner there is a restaurant, sometimes the whole street is a
restaurant, and much of the time there is an adjacent piazza with an
extraordinary piece of original renaissance artwork, by Bernini, or
Michaelangelo, or one of their students.  There are no gas guzzling
SUVs or Wawa gas stations that take up entire city blocks, or miles
upon miles of strip malls which dominate the modern American
landscape.  Even trucks in Italy are small, gas stations are simply a
pump on the side of a road, and a strip mall would look somewhat
incongruous next to the Piazza del Popoli.    So America is different
from the &ldquo;Old World,&rdquo; of Europe, I suppose its because we
have so much extra land that we don&rsquo;t know what to do with. 
We&rsquo;ve supersized western culture and left its originators in
the dust, in this &ldquo;Old World&rdquo; that is so small and so
behind the times.  But in this landscape there is a story to tell, as
there is in all landscapes.  And as I glided over the rustic
Northwestern Italian coast with its dull yellow grass thinly letting
the dull brown dirt seep through on United Air flight whatever, I
could not help but marvel at the radiance that dozed next to me as
the sun came up.

	Her face needs no external illumination; its beauty is luminescent
enough.  The freckles congregate on the bridge of her nose and then
as if its slope was a playground sliding board, they slide down and
rarify upon her cheeks.  I always thought that this was because her
skin was far too soft and smooth for any of the freckles to avoid
slipping down the slope of her small, well-shaped nose which would
more than occasionally turn red at the end from allergies or colds or
irritation.  Her large green eyes show various degrees of our new
brownish landscape in them.  They draw you in with their large naked
innocence, beckoning you to come forward to take a closer look, where
you discover that they have themselves seen suffering too and have
more depth than innocence.  Her longish medium brown hair is let down
covering her one shoulder as her small head rests against the plastic
window pane.  Her eyes are covered and her mouth is slightly ajar, as
it always is when she sleeps.  And as much as I am in awe of the
beauty of a sunrise over the picturesque Italian coast, I am left
breathless by her lithe figure.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She woke up as we neared Rome&rsquo;s Fumincino airport as we began
our descent.  Her lashes danced, she yawned, and her svelte body
straightened itself to an upright position on her seat.  She turned
to me noticing my attention was on her and asked that most banal
question reserved mostly for children in the backseat of a car on
their way to family vacation, &ldquo;Are we there yet?&rdquo;  She
smiled.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Here have some gum so
your ears don&rsquo;t fall off while we&rsquo;re landing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She smirked and said, &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; while taking the gum.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We arrived at the airport and picked up our bags, I had in addition
to my luggage bags also picked up bags under my eyes, I had not slept
the entire flight which encompassed an entire night.  I believe it
was the fact that I cannot sleep upright comfortably; although it
could have been the fact that I did not want to take my eyes off of
her.  We stood outside of the airport and found her mother waiting to
greet us.  We set off on a train into Rome.  The train took us to the
outskirts of Rome; from there we took a few different subway trains
and arrived at the station Flaminio.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We disembarked and walked with our luggage out of the station and
onto the street.  It was dry and very hot, the streets reflected the
heat as they were built with black stones, which, worn from use, were
smooth and reflective.  We crossed a very busy convoluted
intersection and walked into the Piazza del Popoli.  This piazza is a
large circle a hundred yards or more in diameter.  An obelisk rises
out of the middle of it flanked on four sides by fountains where
lions spit water into pools.  Three main avenues begin at the
Southern end of the piazza and on that Southern end two magnificent
buildings with Latin inscriptions stand, guarding as it were, the
passageway to Rome&rsquo;s center.  I suppose they were churches,
although I never found out for sure.  Guarding the Northern end of
the piazza were giant columns with Latin inscriptions on headstones
on top of them.  The center of the piazza was lower than the rest of
it, which gave it a slight amphitheater like appearance.  It was the
piazza of the people, and the people enjoyed it, all around it people
walked or sat, or rested from the heat in cafes on the side.  It was
nice to see people outside in the middle of the day enjoying their
city.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We came to the apartment and rested a bit, but decided to
investigate the city before dinnertime.  Her mother had gone to teach
a class and we were left alone in an eternal city, what could we do
but explore, although I was almost delirious from having not slept
two hours in the past 30.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We began walking South down the Via Ripetta, a stone street like all
the streets in Rome, and although it was a main throughway of the
city, it was no wider than a Philadelphian side street.  This road,
as most others in the city, is marked by large apartments with
restaurants on the bottom floor.  All the buildings look as if they
were cast in a plaster mold with irregularities in the siding.  They
were beautiful and I knew that most, if not all of them had seen
history dating back past Napoleon, the unification of Italy, a world
war, and the whirlwind changes of twentieth century technology.  Most
stood about seven stories tall with a large atrium inside, and were
furnished, as ours was in the most modern style with solid, bright,
contrasting colors.  The differences between the outside and the
inside struck me as an amusing contrast of past and present.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	The via Ripetta is a beautiful street, but so are almost all Roman
streets.  We walked along the sliver of sidewalk sometimes
interrupted by cafes.  Sparse traffic from very compact cars rumbled
by on the old street made of black inlaid stones.  And tiny motor
scooters whizzed by carelessly, in no hurry, as if there was all the
time in the world.  And maybe there is, but where I&rsquo;m from
there isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We wandered along the street and turned down alleyways based on
whether they were shady or not.  Although it was a dry heat it was
oppressive.  We may as well have been carrying the sun on our backs. 
The series of shaded streets turned from alleyway to alleyway, until
our collective sense of direction failed and we stumbled upon the
Pantheon.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	The Pantheon is one of the most impressive sights I&rsquo;ve ever
seen.  It rises unannounced in the middle of apartment buildings and
restaurants, a six story solid stone dark grey edifice cracked and
worn from the centuries and the wars and the progress that surrounds
it.  A small piazza sits in front of it with five restaurants on the
perimeter and a small fountain in the center; such is the outlay of
most piazzas.  The magnificence of the Pantheon rises up from its
surrounding alleyways and the crowds of people sitting on its steps
or dining in the restaurants, in the shadow of a structure that has
stood the test of time, not only time, but urban time.  Urban time is
crowded and changing dynamically, it wants to knock down the old to
make room for the new, but this survives.  I wondered what it was
like when the ancient Romans</p>

	</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	Marcus and Claudio met outside the Pantheon quite unexpectedly. 
They had arrived from different directions, Claudio was walking North
from his city abode that stood in between the Circus Maximus and the
Coliseum, and Marcus was walking South from his villa North of Rome. 
They had grown up together on the city&rsquo;s patrician streets, and
were now even more well off than they had been growing up.  Claudio
became a master rhetorician and orator, and Marcus rising to the rank
of general in the army.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ho, Claudio.  How have you been?&rdquo;  Marcus began on
seeing Claudio first.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ah, Marcus, my friend it is good to see you.  I&rsquo;ve been
well, what brings you here to the great temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m paying my respects to Mars, who has given our
armies the strength to push back the barbarian hoards attempting to
invade from the North.  They know nothing of valor or bravery.  They
also know nothing of military science, and we have pushed them back
both through their cowardice and ignorance.  They come at us head
over foot, tumbling like logs and we slaughter them at our feet!&rdquo;
 Marcus completed this little speech with an outburst of pride and
hatred for the enemy that Claudio was taken aback.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Well, the barbarians know nothing of our ways, and I shall be
sure to report to the senate what you have told me concerning the
state of our affairs in the North.&rdquo;  Claudio said respectfully.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ah, Claudio, let it be so.  For if we conquer these tribes at
once they shall be ours forever, but if we lose our tenacity, they
may have time to regroup and gain allies.  But even this concerns me
little.  Tell me, Claudio, why you have come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;My wife has died.&rdquo;  Claudio said and paused, &ldquo;I
am giving offerings to Pluto and Venus.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;My friend, why did you say that you were well?  And why are
you giving an offering to Venus for the death of your wife?&rdquo;
asked Marcus concerned and confused.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I am offering to Venus because I am grateful for the love
that I was given even if it is gone.  And upon seeing you, my old
friend, I am well.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I was jostled from my vision by a finger poking me in the ribs.  She
stood next to me smiling, but attempting to pretend as if nothing had
happened looking straight ahead at the giant metal doors of the
Pantheon.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;You think you can just poke me anytime you&rsquo;d like,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;  I asked feigning anger.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She smiled and nodded emphatically.  I tried to poke her in the
stomach but she blocked me.  I tried to poke her in the shoulder with
the same hand but she blocked that and I quickly used my other hand
to poke her quickly in the stomach under the ribs.  I smiled
victoriously and said, &ldquo;Ha, there you see I win.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She laughed and straightened herself.  Smiling she said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not supposed to win.&rdquo;  She attacked with a barrage of index
fingers pointed at my chest.  I grabbed her hands and said, &ldquo;See
you can&rsquo;t win.&rdquo;  I pulled both hands out to my sides
which brought her beautiful body closer and closer to mine.  I wanted
to let her poke me as much as she&rsquo;d like and just hold her
close, the way I used to do.  I let my guard down and her hand
escaped, jabbing me right below the ribs.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ha,&rdquo; she exclaimed mockingly, &ldquo;there you see I
win.  I always win, you should have learned that by now.&rdquo;  I
doubled over in feigned pain from the mock-violent jab in the ribs.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Of course you win, you just wait until I&rsquo;m too tired of
playing your games and then you sweep in to collect your victory, oh
queen of queens.&rdquo;  I said sarcastically. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go
explore some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We wandered out of the Pantheon&rsquo;s area, not knowing where we
were going.  Finally, we saw a sign pointing the way to the Piazza
Navona, among other landmarks.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh the Piazza Navona, that&rsquo;s where the fountain of the
four rivers is.  It&rsquo;s on my list of things to see, let&rsquo;s
go there.&rdquo;  She said excitedly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Sure let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;  We began walking in it&rsquo;s
direction.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;The fountain was made by Bernini in the eighteenth century. 
It&rsquo;s a great piece of renaissance sculpture.&rdquo;  She added.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ah, terrific, well here you go; you get to reap the benefits
of all those hellish art history classes here don&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh, they weren&rsquo;t so bad except for the hundreds of note
cards I had to memorize.  It&rsquo;s a very interesting subject; it&rsquo;s
just that it can&rsquo;t be learnt any other way.  If only they had a
way to assimilate all the knowledge into your brain instantly, that&rsquo;d
be cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yeah, and then they&rsquo;d come up with a pill to make your
shit smell like roses fresh from the garden.&rdquo;  I added
sarcastically.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Hey, it could happen.  When they make me unquestioned ruler
of the universe it will.&rdquo;  She added with a self-satisfied
smile.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yes of course my liege.&rdquo; I said, once more with evident
sarcasm.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;ll happen.&rdquo;  She said laughing.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Of course it will.&rdquo;  I said.  Then I stopped short and
made a deep bow.  She laughed, and grabbed me by the elbow pulling me
up and next to her.  She held on to my elbow more than she needed to,
and I smiled, a large smile from ear to ear.  Her warm, soft hand was
just as I remembered it, perfect.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She let go when we arrived in the Piazza Navona.  It is a long
elliptical piazza, with a large magnificent fountain in the middle
and two smaller fountains on either side.  It is surrounded totally
by caf&eacute;&rsquo;s, gelaterias, restaurants, and churches. 
People are everywhere, sitting by the fountains, selling wares in
little kiosks strewn around the piazza, in caf&eacute;&rsquo;s, and
restaurants everywhere there is activity, but it is leisurely.  There
are no cars just people everywhere, hanging out and enjoying
themselves.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	We approached the main fountain through the crowd.  There were four
sculptures of men, most likely Roman gods I thought, at each corner
of the magnificent obelisk in the middle.  Each of them had a
fountain under them and a pool of water under them.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She explained it to me, &ldquo;Each of the four men represent a
major river, I know one is the Danube, and one is the Nile, but I
forget the other two.  You see how lifelike they are.  It&rsquo;s
because Bernini was one of the greatest sculptors of all time, he was
incredible.  I mean, don&rsquo;t the features just grab you and look
real, like there&rsquo;s blood underneath the marble.&rdquo;  She
paused, I nodded.  &ldquo;Anyway, if you look at the guy over on this
side.&rdquo;  She paused and pointed.  &ldquo;This one right here. 
Do you see how he&rsquo;s looking the other way in disgust, holding
his hand up to block his view or something?&rdquo;  I nodded.  I
hadn&rsquo;t noticed it, but the statue was turning away as if in
disgust, his face looked like he was about to throw up, and he was
holding out his hand as if to say, &ldquo;Ughhhhh, how horrible.&rdquo;
 She continued, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s doing that because of that church
in front of him, right here.&rdquo;  She paused, pointed, and I
looked.  &ldquo;Do you see how that church has a concave front?&rdquo;
 I nodded and said, &ldquo;Yeah, so?&rdquo;  She continued, &ldquo;So,
a church done with a front like that was highly unorthodox at this
time, and was a major no-no in Bernini&rsquo;s school especially. 
The man who designed this church was a student of Bernini&rsquo;s and
was one of his favorites, until he built that church, which Bernini
thought was horrible, and an affront to God.  He was highly offended
and sculpted this guy on the fountain here to show what he thought of
the church and his ex-student.  That&rsquo;s why he is turned away as
if he is disgusted by the church to the point of physical sickness.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s really interesting.  It&rsquo;s kind of
like an art vendetta or something.  Man you art students know
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yes, yes we do,&rdquo; she said and smiled.  &ldquo;Just look
at the fountains and the people and the rock, it&rsquo;s so
beautiful, I can&rsquo;t understand how anyone</p>

	The old master strode into the piazza, with the aid of a cane.  Two
students flanked him as he walked and shared his knowledge.  He may
have been in his mid-seventies.  His life of meticulous chiseling and
painting, attention to detail, and painstaking artistic development,
has left his myopic eyes drooping, and his once, steady and solid
back, hunched.  His skin is withered and his legs quake under the
weight of his frail body, but his mind is sharp.  It is all he has
left.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;This fountain is possibly my best work.&rdquo;  He commented
to his two disciples.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;It is certainly magnificent, teacher, but what about your
work at the Vatican, or our great churches.  Surely they give more
glory to God, so that you&rsquo;re great art reflects his greatness.&rdquo;
 A pupil chimed in.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;however, I have
always thought of what Our Savior had said, &rsquo;Give to God what
is God&rsquo;s, and give to Caesar what is Caesar&rsquo;s.&rsquo;  He
is talking to the people.  I have always believed that he meant what
he left unsaid, which is that you must give to the people, what is
theirs.  Here I have done that, more than in any other work that I
have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;This is certainly true, teacher.&rdquo; The other pupil
responded with a reproachful look at his classmate.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;When I created this fountain, I did it out of a sense of
righteousness, and not for the people, to whom I owe so much.  I have
always been bothered by this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Certainly, teacher, we understand the meaning of the
fountain, and we believe your motives to be righteous.  Such an
affront to God, and in the architecture of his very church, should
not go unreproached.  Your act is noble, and shall serve a reminder
to anyone who would go about blaspheming in the way that this man has
done.  It&rsquo;s an abomination!&rdquo;  The pupil became animated
and indignant at the end of his speech until the master lifted a hand
from his cane to silence him.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No my student, I was wrong.&rdquo;</p>

	&ldquo;The man who built this church that I so insulted was once a
student of mine, but he came under influences other than me, from
Firenze, Bologna, Napoli, and his own imagination.  He threw all that
I had taught him back at me in this church, and I was angry.  But one
should not act out of anger; much less create art out of it.  And I
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;But he was wrong to have foregone your teaching for the
teachings of inferiors.&rdquo;</p>

	&ldquo;No, my student, he created a new school, and I was angry at
him for abandoning mine.  He will one day have students to whom he
will tell how his old teacher, shunned his work and insulted him at
the expense of the public, and he will be correct in his reproach. 
The church is beautiful, as all art is in all its schools.  We
improved upon the ancient schools, and new schools shall improve upon
us.  Art changes, I have learned this in my old age, and one day my
school shall be ancient and all that will be left of it will be my
sculptures and paintings, including this fountain.  I only wish that
he would turn his head and smile at the church.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Teacher, your talk disturbs me.  Your school shall live on as
long as there is art.  People will recognize your greatness and
create art in accordance with your school until the Savior comes
again.&rdquo;  The pupil persisted.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No, my student, you will one day realize that he who fights
against the future will find himself as I find myself, a crippled old
man.&rdquo;

	She put her head on my shoulder, the way she used to, where her long
neck contours to my bony shoulder, and her head rests on the soft
sinewy tendons and muscles of my lower neck.  It came without
warning, roused me from my daydream, and reduced me to a puddle.  My
knees went limp, my head spun, and my mind wandered in its spinning
haze to the way it was when we were together, and I did not feel
compelled to mask my heart.  I put my hand around her waist, that
beautiful thin waist, where my hand fit, like a tailored glove, and I
was in ecstasy.  The epitome of bittersweet, was that moment in time,
so much that I could not endure its torturous rapture for more than a
moment,.  So I broke it.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I straightened myself bringing my shoulder up, which pushed her head
back into its upright position.  &ldquo;I think the church is
beautiful, I understand how it was a break from orthodoxy, but I
can&rsquo;t imagine that an artistic master would fail to recognize
the aesthetic where it lies.&rdquo;  I really just rambled that out,
because I needed to say something to give myself space and time to
recover.  She saw right through it, she always knew when I was being
disingenuous. 
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	So she took a step away from me and gave me the space I needed, to
recover my heart&rsquo;s lost beats.  &ldquo;He considered it an
affront to God.  I suppose he thought that because no Christian
architecture had ever had such a design, and possibly pagan ones had,
I&rsquo;m not sure, but that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d think.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s reasonable, I suppose that if he
considered the architecture to be an attempt to bring a pagan
influence upon sacred Christianity, which could make sense.  Either
way the fountain is magnificent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;It certainly is, but this piazza isn&rsquo;t too far away,
we&rsquo;ll probably be here a lot, let&rsquo;s go walk some more.&rdquo;
 So we made our way out of the piazza, not knowing exactly where we
were, but knowing that we were most likely no great distance from the
apartment.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Your hair is getting long again.&rdquo; she commented
matter-of-factly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I suppose it is, it&rsquo;s apt to do such things as grow.&rdquo;

lazy for the barber.&rdquo;</p>

	&ldquo;And too poor, way to get a job this summer.&rdquo;  She cut
in quickly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I tried to get one, I really did.  Plus they have room for me

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Ughhhhh, what a horrible job.  You shouldn&rsquo;t do it,
it&rsquo;s mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I guess, but its better than nothing.  This way I&rsquo;ll be
able to get my hair cut this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;  She asked with surprising expectancy.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Well you should, it looks better on you.&rdquo;</p>

	&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re telling me that you

floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She giggled.  &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s an order to that mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s an order to the mess on my head.&rdquo;  I
concluded triumphantly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Psssht.&rdquo;  She turned her head mock-indignantly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you with your hair buzzed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh, I plan on it, and I may let you see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d be honored if I could milady.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Oh shut up.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I laughed.  We had crossed a large, very busy street and found
ourselves on a bridge over the river Tiber.  It wasn&rsquo;t a wide
river, and had long since been kidnapped from its mother nature and
come under the dominance of our human race.  The banks were
sidewalks, on which very few people walked, and after the unused
sidewalks a levee stood some thirty foot high leading onto the very
busy road or the bridge which stood some forty to fifty feet above
the deep green water at its apex.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Fancy a dip?&rdquo;  I asked her</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;You first.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Wanna go down and sit there anyway, its gotta be cooler than
up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Yeah, sure.&rdquo;  She nodded and we walked down the steps.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	It was cooler down there.  The water, obviously polluted from
centuries of advanced civilization, and human development was crusted
in some parts with algae because the river was very slow moving, as
if it had been mellowed by the monotonous rise and fall of the
empires it has seen.  Mostly though, the river just looked very
polluted, and worn out.  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Hey, did you see that?&rdquo;  She asked me suddenly.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;A fish just jumped out of the water, it was huge in the
middle of the river.&rdquo;  We paused watching, &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s
another one.&rdquo;  She exclaimed after a few seconds.  I saw that
one.  It looked like a large pikefish, if there are pikefish in
Italy, which I doubt.  It was about a shoulders breadth long.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that the pollution could have mutated a
goldfish into that.&rdquo;  I said.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She laughed at my corny joke, she always did that.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why you don&rsquo;t flush them down the toilet in Italy, they
mutate.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	She turned around toward the river and looked at it after she said
that.  I was standing about two paces behind her.  So I suddenly ran
up from behind and grabbed her by the arms as if to throw her in the
water, I even lifted her off the ground.  She shrieked.  But I set
her back down on dry land.  I turned around laughing raucously.  She
was inflamed and came at me with both fingers flicking at my ears. 
For some reason she had always associated ear flicking with some kind
of disgrace or punishment.  The memory of this only made me laugh
harder.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you scare me like that.&rdquo;  She chided me and
began to laugh herself.  I grabbed her hands and immobilized them not
allowing her to flick me anymore.  She never liked feeling weaker
than anyone else, and began fighting me relentlessly for the use of
her hands.  I gave them up when I tired from the game, and she
flicked me again, after I had given her hands back to her.  I
laughed.  She turned away and walked back toward the river with her
back to me with another air of mock-indignation.  She took three
steps and then faltered on the fourth, as if unsure of where to put
her foot.  She put it down and turned to me, but her look had a
wholly different quality than what I had expected.  It was not
indignant in the least, nor malicious, nor teasing, nor playful.  I
had only seen a look one other time in my life and she was the one
who gave it to me then too.</p>

	An American dorm room, 12&rsquo; x 12&rsquo;, white cinder block
walls, which do little to keep out the winter chill, a bed with a
cover and a tangle of naked arms and legs and two bodies held close
underneath it, this is beautiful.  We look each other in the eyes and
kiss, softly closed mouth, on the lips.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I love you.&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	The mid-February wind blew outside the inadequately insulated room,
and we heard its high-pitched whine.  	</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	I squeezed her against me, and she squeezed me tight too.  I loosed
my arms but she kept hers taut for another ten or so seconds.  She
leant back, my arms cradling her, and gave me a funny look like
futility mixed with resignation and a sense of indignation at an
injustice.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I love you, but this isn&rsquo;t right, and

	&ldquo;I know you&rsquo;ve been feeling like that lately, but we&rsquo;ll
get through it together I mean I know something hasn&rsquo;t been
quite right for a little while, but we&rsquo;ve only been together a
few months, and we&rsquo;ll get through it.&rdquo;  I said this
quickly to placate her doubts with my blind optimism, but towards the
end I realized that it wasn&rsquo;t working this time.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;This hasn&rsquo;t been working, I think I need time.  I

and I don&rsquo;t know what I want and I don&rsquo;t know how to love
you the way you love me and I need to find things out about myself,
because I don&rsquo;t know why this doesn&rsquo;t work.  You&rsquo;re
everything I want.&rdquo;  
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re everything I want too,&rdquo; I put in
quickly, I was almost panicking, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need anything
but you, and I&rsquo;ll do anything to make this right, I&rsquo;ll
sail the Pacific with a canoe, I&rsquo;ll walk on hot coals, I&rsquo;ll
swim in the East River, I&rsquo;ll go on a mythical quest.&rdquo; 
All the time I was saying this, and I was saying it frantically, she
was shaking her head sorrowfully.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lasso the moon;
I&rsquo;ll bring it down just for you.&rdquo;  I added with a
hopeless smile.</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;You know better than all this.&rdquo;  She deadpanned while

	&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, I love you, I don&rsquo;t want to hurt you,

<p class="western" align="justify" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%; orphans: 0; widows: 0">
	&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be sorry, you&rsquo;re the best thing that ever
